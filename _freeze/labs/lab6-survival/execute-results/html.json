The data is posted on the class web pages (prostaticcancer.dta, prostaticcancer.dat). We will consider four variables in this lab:\n\n-   Time: Time to death or censoring (months)\n-   Status: Indicator of death (status=0 if subject censored, status=1 if subject died)\n-   Treatment: Two treatments are considered. Treatment 1 is placebo, Treatment 2 is DES\n-   Index: Gleason index, a measure of disease severity\n\nPerform analyses to determine whether the distribution of time to relapse differs across groups defined by treatment and index.\n\n### R functions\n\nSome useful R functions\n\n-   Surv\n-   survfit\n-   survdiff\n-   ggsurvplot\n-   coxph\n\n## Setup\n\n### Pacakges\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLoading required package: Hmisc\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'Hmisc'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    format.pval, units\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLoading required package: ggpubr\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'survminer'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:survival':\n\n    myeloma\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Load data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncancer <- stata.get(\"https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/CourseBios312/prostaticcancer.dta\")\nnames(cancer)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"patient\"   \"treatment\" \"time\"      \"status\"    \"age\"       \"shb\"      \n[7] \"size\"      \"index\"    \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(cancer)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    patient        treatment          time           status      \n Min.   : 1.00   Min.   :1.000   Min.   : 2.00   Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:10.25   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:42.25   1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :19.50   Median :2.000   Median :56.00   Median :0.0000  \n Mean   :19.50   Mean   :1.526   Mean   :49.74   Mean   :0.1579  \n 3rd Qu.:28.75   3rd Qu.:2.000   3rd Qu.:65.00   3rd Qu.:0.0000  \n Max.   :38.00   Max.   :2.000   Max.   :70.00   Max.   :1.0000  \n      age             shb             size           index       \n Min.   :51.00   Min.   :10.70   Min.   : 2.00   Min.   : 6.000  \n 1st Qu.:65.00   1st Qu.:13.43   1st Qu.: 4.00   1st Qu.: 8.000  \n Median :71.00   Median :13.85   Median : 7.50   Median : 9.000  \n Mean   :68.63   Mean   :13.94   Mean   :10.47   Mean   : 9.132  \n 3rd Qu.:73.00   3rd Qu.:14.68   3rd Qu.:13.75   3rd Qu.:10.000  \n Max.   :77.00   Max.   :16.40   Max.   :37.00   Max.   :12.000  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Questions\n\n### 1. Before looking at the data, we should decide if we are going to robust standard errors or not\n\n-   What are the benefits of using robust standard errors over classical PH regression?\n\n-   What are the benefits of using classical standard error over robust standard errors?\n\n### 2. Provide suitable descriptive statistics regarding the distribution of time to relapse according to treatment status.\n\n-   Create and plot Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival curves by treatment\n\n-   What is the (approximate) survival estimate at 30 months for each treatment arm? What is it at 60 months? Obtain the estimate and 95% confidence interval for survival at 30 months. Interpret the estimate and CI.\n\n-   What is the estimated median survival time in each treatment arm? Provide a 95% confidence interval for these estimates. Interpret the estimate and CI.\n\n### 3. List the variables time and status for the subjects with treatment==2\n\n-   Be able to interpret what each row indicates in terms of event/censoring time and event/censoring indicator. That is, which observations are events and which are censored? When did each occur?\n\n-   Calculate by hand the Kaplan-Meier estimate of survivorship for the first few event times. Compare to the plot. At which time points does survivorship decrease? At which time points does it stay the same?\n\n### 4. Perform analysis comparing the instantaneous risk of relapse across groups defined treatment status using the following approaches. Compare the inference obtained from each approach.\n\n-   The log rank test (this is a score test)\n\n-   Cox proportional hazard regression using classical standard errors. This will give both a Wald and Likelihood Ratio test\n\n-   Cox proportional hazard regression using robust standard errors. This will give a Wald test\n\n-   When you \"compare the inference obtained...\", interpret the hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.\n\n### 5. Perform a proportional hazards regression comparing the instantaneous risk of relapse across groups defined by Gleason index (index). Compare the inference obtained from each approach.\n\n-   Cox proportional hazard regression using classical standard errors.\n\n-   Cox proportional hazard regression using robust standard errors.\n",
