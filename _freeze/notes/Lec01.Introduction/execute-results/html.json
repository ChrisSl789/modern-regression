Also, identical prompts at different times can give different answers\n  \n\n## Guiding Principles\n\n* Alternative course title: How to Use Statistics to Answer Scientific Questions (part 2)\n  + Put science before statistics\n  + Emphasize parameter estimates and confidence intervals (credible intervals, likelihood intervals) over hypothesis testing and p-values \n    - The End of Statistical Significance (Jonathan Sterne)\n    - What's Wrong with P-Values (Bland, Altman)\n    - Key difference between scientific/clinical significance and statistical significance\n* This is a course in Biostatistics, not coding in R/Stata\n  + I will show you how to get an interpret the key statistics, but not interpret every number of the Stata output\n  + Often there is more than one way to arrive at identical final answers\n\n## Example: Clinical vs Scientific significance\n\n* 5 clinical trials conducted to determine if drug A, B, or C lowers cholesterol\n* Assume that a decrease of 10 mg/dl or more is important to clinicians\n* Study design\n  + Cholesterol measured at baseline, subjects take drug for 1 month, Cholesterol measured at 1 month\n  + Change in cholesterol is the outcome of interest\n\n| Trial | Drug | Pts | Mean diff | Std dev | Std error | 95% CI for diff | p-value |\n|-------|------|------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------------|---------|\n| 1 | A | 30 | -30 | 191.7 | 49.5 | [-129, 69] | 0.55 |\n| 2 | A | 1000 | -30 | 223.6 | 10 | [-49.6, -10.4] | 0.002 |\n| 3 | B | 40 | -20 | 147.6 | 33 | [-85, 45] | 0.55 |\n| 4 | B | 4000 | -2 | 147.6 | 3.3 | [-8.5, 4.5] | 0.54 |\n| 5 | C | 5000 | -6 | 100.0 | 2 | [-9.9, -2.1] | 0.002 |\n\n# Grading and Evaluation\n\n## Evaluation components and grade percentages\n\n* Midterm (25\\%)\n* Final Exam (25\\%)\n* Homework and quizzes (25\\%)\n* Project (25\\%)\n* Class participation\n* This is a 4-credit course.  Your lab and lecture grades will be the same\n\n## Homework\n\n* Up to 1 per week (probably 6 or 7 total)\n* Will focus on real data analysis and interpretation with some mathematical derivations of important quantities\n* Questions will focus on specific analyses, with questions stated in as scientific terms as possible\n* Work handed in should address the scientific questions\n   - Format Table and Figures\n   - No raw, unformatted output\n* Keys will be provided shortly after the homework is turned in\n   - No late homework accepted after the key is posted\n* Answers in keys may go beyond what is expected of your homework and present concepts in more detail. You are responsible for any material in the keys for exams.\n* You may discuss the homework with others in the class, but the work you turn in should be your own\n* Use Brightspace to turn in homeworks and receive feedback and grade\n\n## Exams\n\n* Exams: Midterm and Final in class\n  - Focus on understanding concepts, not memorizing formulas\n  - I will provide an example midterm and final\n  - For midterm, you will be allowed 1 page of your own notes\n  - For final, you will be allowed 2 pages of your own notes\n* Quizzes\n  - At my discretion will may have 10-minute quiz in lab\n\n## Project\n\n* Detailed analysis of a dataset\n  - Prepare a 4-10 page reporting of your results (excluding tables and figures)\n  - Will be assigned at mid-point of course; more details at that time\n\n# Course Materials\n\n## Course notes\n\n* Course notes will be the primary source\n* Available on web page: ADD LINK\n* Daily class schedule including notes for that day\n* Notes will be updated throughout semester\n\n## Recommended Textbook: Regression Methods in Biostatistics\n\n* Vittinghoff, Glidden, Shiboski, and McCulloch\n* Pros\n   + Covers applied linear, logistic, survival, and repeated measures regression\n   + Biomedical orientation\n* Cons\n   + Does not discuss robust standard errors, which I will use almost exclusively\n   + Emphasizes model diagnostics more that I will\n   + Does not cover Bayesian approaches\n   + Does not cover matrix algebra\n   + Little theory and mathematical derivation\n\n## Additional textbooks\n\n* Weisberg, Applied Linear Regression\n  + Uses matrix notation and appropriate level of statistical theory for this course\n  + Poor for applied data analysis.  Earlier version limited to linear models, no Bayesian approaches\n* Bayesian Regression textbook\n  + Newer text that I am still evaluating\n  + Provides a Bayesian approach to fitting the models we discuss\n* I will give recommended readings throughout the semester\n* If the course notes and book differ, go with the notes\n\n\n\n",
