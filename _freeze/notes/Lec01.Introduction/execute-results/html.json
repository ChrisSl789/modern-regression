Also, identical prompts at different times can give different answers\n\n## Guiding Principles\n\n-   Alternative course title: How to Use Statistics to Answer Scientific Questions (part 2)\n    -   Put science before statistics\n    -   Emphasize parameter estimates and confidence intervals (credible intervals, likelihood intervals) over hypothesis testing and p-values\n        -   The End of Statistical Significance (Jonathan Sterne)\n        -   What's Wrong with P-Values (Bland, Altman)\n        -   Key difference between scientific/clinical significance and statistical significance\n-   This is a course in Biostatistics, not coding in R/Stata\n    -   I will show you how to get an interpret the key statistics, but not interpret every number on output\n    -   Often there is more than one way to arrive at identical final answers\n\n## Example: Clinical vs Scientific significance\n\n-   5 clinical trials conducted to determine if drug A, B, or C lowers cholesterol\n-   Assume that a decrease of 10 mg/dl or more is important to clinicians\n-   Study design\n    -   Cholesterol measured at baseline, subjects take drug for 1 month, Cholesterol measured at 1 month\n    -   Change in cholesterol is the outcome of interest\n\n| Trial | Drug | Pts  | Mean diff | Std dev | Std error | 95% CI for diff  | p-value |\n|-------|------|------|-----------|---------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n| 1     | A    | 30   | -30       | 191.7   | 49.5      | \\[-129, 69\\]     | 0.55    |\n| 2     | A    | 1000 | -30       | 223.6   | 10        | \\[-49.6, -10.4\\] | 0.002   |\n| 3     | B    | 40   | -20       | 147.6   | 33        | \\[-85, 45\\]      | 0.55    |\n| 4     | B    | 4000 | -2        | 147.6   | 3.3       | \\[-8.5, 4.5\\]    | 0.54    |\n| 5     | C    | 5000 | -6        | 100.0   | 2         | \\[-9.9, -2.1\\]   | 0.002   |\n\n# Grading and Evaluation\n\n## Evaluation components and grade percentages\n\n-   Midterm (25%)\n-   Take Home Exam (25%)\n-   Final Exam (25%)\n-   Homework (25%)\n-   Class participation\n-   This is a 4-credit course. Your lab and lecture grades will be the same\n\n## Homework\n\n-   Up to 1 per week (probably 6 or 7 total)\n-   Will focus on real data analysis and interpretation with some mathematical derivations of important quantities\n-   Questions will focus on specific analyses, with questions stated in as scientific terms as possible\n-   Work handed in should address the scientific questions\n    -   Format Table and Figures\n-   Keys will be provided shortly after the homework is turned in\n    -   No late homework accepted after the key is posted\n-   Answers in keys may go beyond what is expected of your homework and present concepts in more detail. You are responsible for any material in the keys for exams.\n-   You may discuss the homework with others in the class, but the work you turn in should be your own\n-   Use Brightspace to turn in homeworks and receive feedback and grade\n\n## In Class Exams\n\n-   Midterm and Final in class\n    -   Focus on understanding concepts, not memorizing formulas\n    -   I will provide an example midterm and final\n    -   For midterm, you will be allowed 1 page of your own notes\n    -   For final, you will be allowed 2 pages of your own notes\n-   All output will be provide for you to interpret\n\n## Take Home Exam\n\n-   Will be given approximately mid point between Midterm and Final\n-   Demonstrate ability to obtain results through software and interpret findings\n-   One day to complete and turn in\n    -   Likely will be a Monday with no lab scheduled for that day\n-   Practice for applied portion of first year comprehensive exams\n-   Similar to Homework, but work should be your own\n\n# Course Materials\n\n## Course notes\n\n-   Course notes will be the primary source\n-   Available on web page\n-   Daily class schedule will indicate notes being covered\n-   Notes will be updated throughout semester\n\n## Recommended Textbook: Regression Methods in Biostatistics\n\n-   Vittinghoff, Glidden, Shiboski, and McCulloch\n-   Pros\n    -   Covers applied linear, logistic, survival, and repeated measures regression\n    -   Biomedical orientation\n-   Cons\n    -   Does not discuss robust standard errors, which I will use almost exclusively\n    -   Emphasizes model diagnostics more that I will\n    -   Does not cover Bayesian approaches\n    -   Does not cover matrix algebra\n    -   Little theory and mathematical derivation\n\n## Additional textbooks\n\n-   Weisberg, Applied Linear Regression\n    -   Uses matrix notation and appropriate level of statistical theory for this course\n    -   Poor for applied data analysis. Earlier version limited to linear models, no Bayesian approaches. Newer version is more comprehensive.\n-   Wakefield, Bayesian and Frequentist Regression Methods\n    -   Newer text that I am still evaluating\n    -   Provides a Bayesian approach to fitting the models we discuss\n-   I will give recommended readings throughout the semester\n-   If the course notes and book differ, go with the notes\n\n## Supplemental Material\n\n-   As needed, I will post supplemental material on the course web page or on Brightspace\n\n    -   I prefer the course web page, if possible\n\n    -   Brightspace will be used if necessary\n\n-   Relevant supplemental material will be noted on course schedule\n\n## Getting started\n\n-   To do on your own by Thursday...\n\n    -   Download and install new versions of R and Rstudio\n\n        -   Details on course web page, computing\n\n-   I would like everyone (including Stata users) to be able to Render a basic Quarto document\n\n-   Plan to start discussing Quarto next Tuesday\n\n    -   It is difficult to anticipate all issues that might arise, so I would like to resolve any major software issues before then\n",
