Provide a Bayesian and Frequentist interpretation.\" VUMC aiChat tool, GPT-4. Retrieved 12/28/2023.\n\n::: {.classname style=\"color: gray\"}\nIn simple linear regression, the slope (often denoted as \"b\" or \"beta\") is interpreted as the expected change in the dependent (or response) variable for a one-unit increase in the independent (or predictor) variable, assuming all other variables are held constant.\n\nFrom a Frequentist perspective, the slope is considered a fixed but unknown value which is estimated from the sample data. If the slope is found to be 2, for instance, it would suggest that for every one-unit increase in our predictor variable, we expect, on average, a 2-unit increase in the response variable. This is based on the data at hand and is subject to sampling variability. Confidence intervals can be constructed around this estimate to provide a range of plausible values for this unknown fixed parameter. If a 95% confidence interval for the slope is (1.5, 2.5), it would suggest that we are 95% confident that the true slope falls within this range.\n\nIn contrast, a Bayesian approach treats the slope as a random variable. Rather than a single fixed value, the slope has a distribution of possible values. This distribution combines our prior beliefs about what the slope might be (prior distribution) and the observed data (likelihood). The resulting distribution (posterior distribution) reflects our updated belief about the slope after seeing the data. If the mean of the posterior distribution is 2, it suggests that, given the prior and the data, our best guess is that a one-unit increase in the predictor variable corresponds to a 2-unit increase in the response variable on average. A credible interval, say a 95% credible interval of (1.5, 2.5), suggests that there is a 95% probability that the true value of the slope falls within this range, given our prior and the observed data.\n:::\n\n-   When to use Bayesian or frequentist approaches to estimation[^2]\n\n    -   On many occasions, if one is careful in execution, both approaches to analysis will yield essentially equivalent inference\n\n    -   For small sample sizes, Bayesian approaches with carefully considered priors are often the only way to go because it is difficult to obtain well-calibrated frequentist intervals\n\n    -   For medium to large samples, unless there is strong prior information that one wants to incorporate, robust frequentist estimation using sandwich estimation is very appealing because its consistency is guaranteed under mild conditions\n\n    -   For highly complex models, a Bayesian approach is often the most convenient way to formulate the model, and computation under the Bayesian approach is the most straightforward\n\n    -   In summary, in many instances carefully considered Bayesian and frequentist approach will lead to similar scientific conclusions. My goal is describe the advantages and shortcoming of each approach, but a strong recommendation of one over the other is not given as there is often no reason for stating a preference.\n\n[^2]: Wakefield, Jon. Bayesian and Frequentist Regression Methods. Section 1.6, Executive Summary\n\n### Uses of Regression\n\n-   Borrowing information\n\n    -   Use other groups to make estimates in groups with sparse data\n\n    -   Intuitively, 67 and 69 year olds would provide some relevant information about 68 year olds\n\n    -   Assuming a straight line relationship tells us about other, even more distant, individuals\n\n    -   If we do not want to assume a straight line, we may only want to borrow information from nearby groups\n\n    -   Locally weighted scatterplot smooth line (lowess) added to the previous figures\n\n    -   Splines discussed in future lectures\n\n    -   May not want to borrow too much information\n\n-   Linear relationship is an assumption, with often low power to detect departures from linearity\n\n-   Always avoid extrapolating beyond the range of the data (e.g. ages under 65 or over 100)\n\n-   Defining \"Contrasts\"\n\n    -   Define a comparison across groups to use when answering scientific questions\n\n    -   If the straight line relationship holds, the slope is the difference in mean cholesterol levels between groups differing by 1 year in age\n\n    -   Do we want to assume that comparisons of 65 to 66 year old subjects are the same as comparisons of 95 to 96 year old subjects?\n\n    -   If a non-linear relationship, the slope is still the average difference in mean cholesterol levels between groups differing by 1 year in age\n\n    -   Slope is a (first order or linear) test for trend\n\n### Linear Regression Inference\n\n-   Regression output provides\n\n    -   Estimates\n\n        -   Intercept: Estimated mean cholesterol when age is 0\n\n        -   Slope: Estimated average difference in average cholesterol for two groups differing by 1 year in age\n\n        -   Standard errors\n\n    -   Confidence intervals\n\n    -   P-values for testing\n\n        -   Intercept is zero (usually unimportant)\n\n        -   Slope is zero (test for linear trend in means)\n\n-   (Frequentist) Interpretation\n\nFrom linear regression analysis, we estimate that for each year difference in age, the difference in mean cholesterol is 0.32 mg/dL. A 95% confidence interval (CI) suggests that this observation is not unusual if the true difference in mean cholesterol per year difference in age were between 0.05 and 0.59 mg/dL. Because $p = 0.02$, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no linear trend in the average cholesterol across age groups using a significance level, $\\alpha$, of $0.05$.\n\n## Simple Linear Regression\n\n### Ingredients\n\n-   Response\n\n    -   The distribution of this variable will be compared across groups\n\n    -   Linear regression models the mean of the response variable\n\n    -   Log transformation of the response corresponds to modeling the geometric mean\n\n    -   Notation: It is extremely common to use $Y$ to denote the response variable when discussing general methods\n\n-   Predictor\n\n    -   Group membership is measured by this variable\n\n    -   Notation\n\n        -   When not using mnemonics, will be referred to as the $X$ variable in simple linear regression (linear regression with one predictor)\n\n        -   Later, when we discuss multiple regression, will refer to $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p$ when there are up to $p$ predictors\n\n-   Regression Model\n\n    -   We typically consider a \"linear predictor function\" that is linear in the modeled predictors\n\n    -   Expected value (i.e. mean) of $Y$ for a particular value of $X$\n\n    -   $E[Y | X] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times X$\n\n    -   In a deterministic world, a line is of the form $y = mx + b$\n\n        -   With no variation in the data, each value of $y$ would like exactly on a straight line\n\n        -   Intercept $b$ is values of $y$ when $x = 0$\n\n        -   Slope $m$ is the difference in $y$ for a one unit difference in $x$\n\n    -   Statistics in not completely deterministic. The real world has variability\n\n        -   Response within groups is variable (people born on the same day will have different cholesterol levels!)\n\n            -   Randomness due to other variables impacting cholesterol\n\n            -   Inherent randomness\n\n-   The regression line thus describes the central tendency of the data in a scatterplot of the response versus the predictor\n\n-   Interpretation of regression parameters\n\n    -   Intercept $\\beta_0$: Mean $Y$ for a group with $X=0$\n\n        -   Often $\\beta_0$ is not of scientific interest\n\n        -   May be out of the range of data, or even impossible to observe $X=0$\n\n    -   Slope $\\beta_1$: Difference in mean $Y$ across groups differing in $X$ by 1 unit\n\n        -   Usually measures association between $Y$ and $X$\n\n        -   $E[Y | X] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times X$\n\n-   Derivation of interpretation\n\n    -   Simple linear regression of response $Y$ on predictor $X$\n\n    -   Mean of any arbitrary group can be derived from the equation $$\n         Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i\n         $$\n\n    -   Interpretation determined by considering possible values of $X$\n\n    -   Model: $E[Y_i | X_i] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times X_i$\n\n        -   When $X_i = 0$, $E[Y_i | X_i = 0 ] = \\beta_0$\n\n        -   When $X_i = x$, $E[Y_i | X_i = x ] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$\n\n        -   When $X_i = x + 1$, $E[Y_i | X_i = x + 1 ] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_1$\n\n        -   We can use the above to get an equation for $\\beta_1$\n\n        $$\n         E[Y_i | X_i = x + 1 ] - E[Y_i | X_i = x ] = \\\\\n         (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_1) -

  $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times X_i + \\epsilon_i$\n\n    -   $i = 1, \\ldots, n$\n\n    -   $i$ indexes the independent sampling units (e.g. subjects)\n\n    -   $n$ is the total number of independent sampling units\n\n    -   This formulauation drops the expected value notation, add in $\\epsilon_i$\n\n        -   $\\epsilon_i$ are the \"Residuals\" or \"Errors\"\n\n        -   $E[\\epsilon_i] = 0$\n\n        -   $V[\\epsilon_i] = \\sigma^2$ (constant variance assumption)\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\newcommand\\Ybd{{\\boldsymbol{Y}}}\n\\newcommand\\Xbd{{\\boldsymbol{X}}}\n\\newcommand\\betabd{{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}}\n\\newcommand\\epsilonbd{{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}}\n\\newcommand\\zerovec{{\\boldsymbol{0}}}\n\\newcommand\\onevec{{\\boldsymbol{1}}}\n\\newcommand\\eye{{\\boldsymbol{I}}}\n```\n\n-   Matrix notation: ${\\boldsymbol{Y}}= {\\boldsymbol{X}}{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}+ {\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}$\n\n${\\boldsymbol{Y}}= \\left( \\begin{array}{c} Y_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n \\end{array} \\right)_{n\\times1}$ ${\\boldsymbol{X}}= \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 & x_1 \\\\ 1 & x_2 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & x_n \\end{array} \\right)_{n\\times2}$ ${\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}= \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right)_{2\\times1}$ ${\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}= \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_n \\end{array} \\right)_{n\\times1}$\n\n$E[{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}] = {\\boldsymbol{0}}$, where ${\\boldsymbol{0}}= \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\0 \\end{array} \\right)_{n\\times1}$\n\n$V[{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}] = \\sigma^2 {\\boldsymbol{I}}$, where ${\\boldsymbol{I}}= \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & \\ldots & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & \\ldots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\ldots & 1 \\end{array} \\right)_{n\\times n}$\n\n$E[{\\boldsymbol{Y}}] = {\\boldsymbol{X}}{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$\n\n-   I am using standard notation to indicate matrices/vectors and scalars\n\n-   Boldface indicates a vector or matrix (${\\boldsymbol{Y}}$, ${\\boldsymbol{X}}$, ${\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$, ${\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}$, ${\\boldsymbol{0}}$, ${\\boldsymbol{I}}$)\n\n-   Normal typeface indicates a scalar ($Y_i$, $x_i$, $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$, $\\epsilon_i$, $0$, $1$)\n\n## Example Analysis of BMI (Part 1)\n\n-   Example analysis conducted in class involving BMI (response) with gender (predictor 1) and age (predictor 2)\n\n-   This is \"Lab 1\" and will serve as an example of how future labs will proceed\n\n## Residuals\n\n-   Often linear regression models are specified in terms of the response instead of the mean response\n\n    -   Include an error term in the model, $\\epsilon_i$\n\n    -   Model $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\epsilon_i$\n\n-   The linear regression model is divided into two parts\n\n    -   The mean, or systematic, part (the \"signal\")\n\n    -   The error, or random, part (the \"noise\")\n\n-   Residuals\n\n    -   $\\hat{\\epsilon}_i = Y_i - \\left(\\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} X_i\\right)$\n\n    -   $\\hat{{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}} = {\\boldsymbol{Y}}- {\\boldsymbol{X}}\\hat{{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}}$\n\n    -

  In our example analysis of BMI and gender, the RMSE is exactly equal to the pooled estimate of the standard deviation from a two-sample, equal variance t-test\n\n    -   In our example analysis of BMI and age, the RMSE is the square root of the average variances across the age groups\n\n-   In many textbooks, $\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$\n\n    -   A common $\\sigma^2$ implies constant variance across all levels of the grouping variable, \"homoscedasticity\"\n\n    -   Normality of the residuals is a nice property, but it is not necessary (and rarely observed in practice)\n\n    -   We will discuss how lack of Normality and heteroscedasticity impact statistical inference\n\n## Assumptions and Inference with Linear Regression\n\n### The Big Three Assumptions\n\n-   Most common uses of regression\n\n    -   Prediction: Estimating what a future value of $Y$ will be based on observed $X$\n\n    -   Comparisons within groups: Describing the distribution of $Y$ across levels of the grouping variable $X$ by estimating the mean $E[Y | X]$\n\n    -   Comparisons across groups: Differences appear across groups if the regression parameter slope estimate $\\beta_1$ is non-zero\n\n-   Valid statistical inference (CIs, p-values) about *associations* requires three general assumptions\n\n-   Assumption 1: Approximately Normal distributions for the parameter estimates\n\n    -   Normal data or \"large\" N\n\n    -   It is often surprising how small \"large\" can be\n\n        -   Definition of large depends on the error distribution and relative sample sizes within each group\n\n        -   With exactly Normally distributed errors, only need one observation (or two to estimate a slope)\n\n        -   With very heavy tails, \"large\" can be very large\n\n        -   See Lumley, et al., Ann Rev Pub Hlth, 2002\n\n-   Assumption 2: Independence of observations\n\n    -   Classic regression: Independence of all observation (now)\n\n    -   Robust standard errors: Correlated observations within identified clusters (later)\n\n-   Assumption 3: Assumption about the variance of observations within groups\n\n    -   Classic regression: Homoscedasticity (equal variance across groups)\n\n    -   Robust standard errors: Allows for unequal variance across groups\n\n### Additional Assumptions for Additional Inference\n\n-   Note that some textbooks will claim there are more than three assumptions. In truth, additional assumptions are not needed to make the aforementioned statistical inference about *associations*. However ...\n\n-   Valid statistical inference (CIs, p-values) about *mean responses in specific groups* requires a further assumption\n\n-   Assumption 4: Adequacy of the linear model\n\n    -   If we are trying to borrow information about the mean from neighboring groups, and we are assuming a straight line relationship, the straight line needs to be true\n\n    -   No longer saying there is just a linear trend in the means, but now need to believe that all the means lie on a straight line\n\n    -   Note that we can model transformations of the measured predictor\n\n-   For inference about *individual observations* (prediction intervals, P-values) in specific groups requires another assumption\n\n-   Assumption 5: Assumptions about the distribution of the errors within each group (a very strong assumption)\n\n    -   Classically: Errors have the same Normal distribution within each grouping variable\n\n    -   Robust standard error will not help\n\n    -   Prediction intervals assume a common error distribution across groups (homoscedasticity)\n\n-   Possible extension: Errors have the same distribution, but not necessarily Normal (rarely implemented in frequentist software)\n\n    -   Bootstrapping\n\n    -   Bayesian analysis\n\n    -   Other flexible approaches\n\n#### Scenario 1: All model assumptions hold\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1234)\nn <- 200\nregassumptions <- data.frame(x=seq(from=0, to=100, length=n))\n# Linear model correct, Normal errors\nregassumptions$y1 <- 5 + 0.2*regassumptions$x + rnorm(n,0,5)\n# Linear model correct, Skewed errors\nregassumptions$y2 <- 5 + 0.2*regassumptions$x + rlnorm(n,0,1)\n# Linear model correct, errors increasing with predictor (so increasing with Y too)\nregassumptions$y3 <- 5 + 0.2*regassumptions$x + rnorm(n,0,1+regassumptions$x*.1)\n# Linear model incorrect, Normal error\nregassumptions$y4<- 5 + 0.2*regassumptions$x + 0.02*(regassumptions$x)^2 + rnorm(n,0,5)\nggplot(regassumptions, aes(x=x, y=y1)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot with best fit line where assumptions of Normality, linearity, homoskedasticity all hold](Lec03.SimpleLinearRegression_files/figure-html/fig-assumptions-true-1.png){#fig-assumptions-true width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel.y1 <- lm(y1 ~ x, data = regassumptions)\ngglm(model.y1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Diagnostic plots where assumptions of Normality, linearity, homoskedasticity all hold](Lec03.SimpleLinearRegression_files/figure-html/fig-assumptions-true-diag-1.png){#fig-assumptions-true-diag width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Can estimate the mean of Y at a given value of X\n-   Can make inference about the association between X and Y (based on the slope)\n-   Can predict new values of Y given X\n\n#### Scenario 2: Error distribution is not Normally distributed\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(regassumptions, aes(x=x, y=y2)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot with best fit line where the error distribution is skewed to the right](Lec03.SimpleLinearRegression_files/figure-html/fig-assumptions-error-distribution-1.png){#fig-assumptions-error-distribution width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel.y2 <- lm(y2 ~ x, data = regassumptions)\ngglm(model.y2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Diagnostic plots where the error distribution is skewed to the right](Lec03.SimpleLinearRegression_files/figure-html/fig-assumptions-error-distribution-diag-1.png){#fig-assumptions-error-distribution-diag width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   If the sample size is large enough, we can estimate the mean of Y at a given value of X (Central Limit Theorem)\n-   If we use \"robust\" standard errors, we can make inference about the association between X and Y (based on the slope)\n    -   Robust standard error relax the assumption of homoskedasticity/common variance\n-   We *cannot* predict new values of Y given X.

It will be biased, even if the sample size is large, the model will still be incorrect\n    -   The good news is that we can fix our mean model to more flexibly model the association.\n        -   Here, we have just included a single slope term to model the association with $X$, $E[Y|X] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X$.\n        -   The correct model in this simple example is $E[Y|X] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X + \\beta_2*X^2$. Note that this model is still a \"linear model\". A \"linear model\" is linear *in the parameters* ($\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$). We can included the quadratic predictor $X^2$ in the model and still have a model that is linear in the parameters.\n-   If we use \"robust\" standard errors, we can make inference about the association between X and Y (based on the slope, $\\beta_1$)\n    -   Robust standard error relax the assumption of homoskedasticity\n    -   While the model is not a great fit, $\\beta_1$ may summarize a first-order trend\n-   We *cannot* predict new values of Y given X. This requires the correct mean model and error distribution.\n\n#### Summary\n\n-   Regression based inference about *associations* is far more trustworthy than estimation of group means or individual predictions.\n\n-   There is much to be gained by using robust variance estimates\n\n::: {#tbl-panel layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n| Linearity | Homoskedasticity | Normality |\n|-----------|------------------|-----------|\n| Y         | Y                | Y         |\n| Y         | Y                | N         |\n| Y         | N                | Y         |\n| Y         | N                | N         |\n| N         | Y                | Y         |\n| N         | Y                | N         |\n| N         | N                | Y         |\n| N         | N                | N         |\n\n: Assumption Holds (Yes/No)\n\n| $\\hat{\\beta}$ | $\\hat{\\textrm {Var}}_{NR}(\\hat{\\beta})$ | $\\hat{\\textrm{ Var}}_R(\\hat{\\beta})$ |\n|----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Y             | Y                                       | Y                                    |\n| Y             | M^2^                                    | M^2^                                 |\n| Y             | N                                       | Y                                    |\n| Y             | N                                       | M^2^                                 |\n| M^1^          | N                                       | M^3^                                 |\n| M^1^          | N                                       | M^2,3^                               |\n| M^1^          | N                                       | M^2^                                 |\n| M^1^          | N                                       | M^2,3^                               |\n\n: Valid Inference (Yes/No/Maybe)\n\nSummary of what is required for valid estimates of $\\beta$ and the variance of beta using the classical, non-robust (NR) and robust (R) approaches. The classic (non-robust) variance is $\\hat{\\textrm{Var}}_{NR}(\\hat{\\beta})$ and the robust variance is $\\hat{\\textrm{Var}}_R(\\hat{\\beta})$\n:::\n\n-   ^1^ First-order trend, if appropriate\n-   ^2^ Approximately valid under large sample sizes\n-   ^3^ If $X$ is random, but not if $X$ is fixed\n\n### Interpreting \"Positive\" Results\n\n-   Slope is statistically different from 0 using robust standard errors\n\n-   Observed data is atypical of a setting with no linear trend in mean response across groups\n\n-   Data suggests evidence of a trend toward larger (or smaller) means in groups having larger values of the predictor\n\n-   (To the extent the data appears linear, estimates of the group means will be reliable)\n\n### Interpreting \"Negative\" Results\n\n-   Many possible reasons why the slope is not statistically different from 0 using robust standard errors\n\n-   There may be no association between the response and predictor\n\n-   There may be an association, but not in the parameter considered (the mean response)\n\n-   There may be an association in the parameter considered, but the best fitting line has zero slope\n\n-   There may be a first order trend in the parameter considered, but we lacked the precision to be confident that it truly exists (a type II error)\n\n## Model Checking\n\n-   Much statistical literature has been devoted to methods for checking the assumptions for regression models\n\n-   My philosophy: Model checking is generally fraught with peril as it necessarily involves multiple comparisons\n\n    -   We cannot reliably use the sampled data to assess whether it accurately portrays the population\n\n    -   We are more worried about the data from the population that we might not have sampled\n\n    -   It is not so much the abnormal points that we see, but the ones that are hiding in the population that will make our model perform badly\n\n    -   But, do tend to worry more when we see a tendency to extreme outliers in the sample or clear departures from model assumptions\n\n    -   If we over-check our model and make adjustments to the model based on our observed data, we will inflate the type I error rate (i.e. will be more likely to claim statistical significance when it doesn't really exist). We run the risk of creating a model that fits our data well but does not generalize.\n\n        -   Estimates are biased away from the null\n\n        -   Reported standard errors are too small\n\n        -   If we fish through the data, we will always find significant results\n\n        -   In clinical trials, often Phase II results are not able to be replicated in Phase III trials\n\n-   Instead of extensive model checking, go back to our choices of inference when planning our analysis\n\n    -   Best to plan for unusual data\n\n    -   There is often little to be lost and much to be gained by using the robust standard error estimates\n\n    -   By using robust errors, avoids much of the need for model checking\n\n    -   Model checking is almost entirely data driven\n\n    -   Robust standard errors is a more logical scientific approach\n\n        -   Minimize the need to presume more knowledge than the question we are trying to answer\n\n        -   E.g., if we don't know how the means might differ, why should we presume to know how the variances or the shape of the distribution might behave?\n\n### Residuals versus fitted values\n\n-   Plot of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ versus $\\hat{y_i}$\n\n-   If assumptions hold, should be a random pattern about zero. See @fig-assumptions-true-diag for example.\n\n-   If you have *a priori* concerns about non-constant variance, this is one potential check\n\n    -   E.g., it is fairly common for uncertainty to increase with outcome. See @fig-assumptions-heteroskedasticity-diag for the resulting \"fan\" pattern that would appear\n\n### Scale-location plot\n\n-   The scale-location plot is very similar to residuals vs fitted values, and is used to evaluate the homoskedasticity assumption\n\n-   It uses the square root of the absolute value of standardized residuals instead of plotting the residuals themselves\n\n-   We want to check two things\n\n    -   That the best fit line is approximately horizontal. If it is, then the average magnitude of the standardized residuals isn't changing much as a function of the fitted values.\n\n    -   That the spread around the fit line doesn't vary with the fitted values. If so, then the variability of magnitudes doesn't vary much as a function of the fitted values.\n\n### QQ plot\n\n-   Used to evaluate Normality of the residuals\n\n    -   If assumptions hold, points should lie on a 1:1 line\n\n-   Plot of standardized residuals versus theoretical quantities from a N(0,1) distribution\n\n    -   If assumptions hold, the standardized residuals should be a random sample from a N(0,1) distribution\n\n    -   We can use quantiles of the Normal distribution to check how closely the observed matches the expected\n\n        -   The 50th percentile of the residuals should be 0\n        -   The 75th percentile of the residuals should be 0.67\n        -   The 90th percentile of the residuals should be 1.28\n        -   The 95th percentile of the residuals should be 1.64\n        -   The 97.5th percentil of the residuals should be 1.96\n\n-   Similar idea would be a histogram or density plot of the (standardized) residuals that could be visually evaluated for Normality\n\n### Residuals versus leverage\n\n-   Used to check for outliers\n\n-   Plot can help us to identify influential observations, if there are any\n\n-   Influence differs from leverage. Not all outliers influence the regression coefficient estimates\n\n## Linear Regression with Robust Standard Error estimates\n\n-   There are several libraries available in R for fitting models with robust error estimates\n\n-   There are also several different flavors of robust estimators\n\n    -   For now, we are going to consider the default \"Huber-White sandwich estimator\"\n\n    -   In Stata, the Huber-White robust estimate of the standard error can be obtained using the 'robust' option\n\n        ``` stata\n        regress chol age, robust\n        ```\n\n-   In the following examples I provide estimates using classical linear regression and linear regression estimate using robust standard errors.

  $\\rho \\approx \\beta \\sqrt{\\frac{\\textrm{Var}(X)}{\\beta^2\\textrm{Var}(X) + \\textrm{Var}(Y | X = x)}}$\n\n    -   $\\beta$: slope between $Y$ and $X$\n\n    -   $\\textrm{Var}(X)$: variance of $X$ in the sample\n\n    -   $\\textrm{Var}(Y | X = x)$: variance of $Y$ in groups having the same value of $X$ (the vertical spread of data)\n\n-   Correlation tends to increase in absolute value as\n\n    -   The absolute value of the slope of the line increases\n\n    -   The variance of data decreases within groups that share a common value of $X$\n\n    -   The variance of $X$ increases\n\n-   Scientific uses of correlation\n\n    -   The slope between $X$ and $Y$ is of scientific interest\n\n    -   The variance of $Y$ given $X=x$ is partly of scientific interest, but can also be impacted by restricting sampling to certain values of another variable\n\n        -   The variance of height given age is less if sampling just males than if sampling both sexes\n\n        -   The variance of $X$ is often set by study design (which is often not of scientific interest)\n\n    -   Hypothesis tests for a nonzero correlation are exactly the same as a test for a nonzero slope in classical linear regression\n\n    -   The statistical significance of a given value of $\\rho$ depends only on the sample size\n\n-   Correlation is more of a statistical measure than a scientific measure\n\n## Regression on Geometric Means: Log transformations\n\n-   Geometric means of distributions are typically analyzed by using linear regression on the log transformed outcome\n\n-   Used for inference under the following circumstances\n\n    -   We are (scientifically) interested in multiplicative rather than additive models\n\n    -   We want to down-weight the impact of outliers\n\n    -   The standard deviation of the response in a groups is proportional to the mean\n\n        -   \"Error is $\\pm 10\\%$\" instead of \"Error is $\\pm 10$\"\n\n### Interpretation of Parameters\n\n-   Linear regression on the log transformed $Y$\n\n-   Note that in statistics $\\textrm{log}$ almost always refers the the natural log ($\\textrm{log}_e$)\n\n-   Model: $E[\\textrm{log} Y_i | X_i] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times X_i$\n\n    -   When $X_i = 0$: $E[\\textrm{log} Y_i | X_i = 0] = \\beta_0$\n\n    -   When $X_i = x$: $E[\\textrm{log} Y_i | X_i = x] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times x$\n\n    -   When $X_i = x+1$: $E[\\textrm{log} Y_i | X_i = x + 1] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times x + \\beta_1$\n\n    -   Restate the model as log link for geometric mean\n\n-   Model: $\\textrm{log GM}[Y_i | X_i] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times X_i$\n\n    -   When $X_i = 0$: $\\textrm{log GM}[Y_i | X_i = 0] = \\beta_0$\n\n    -   When $X_i = x$: $\\textrm{log GM}[Y_i | X_i = x] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times x$\n\n    -   When $X_i = x+1$: $\\textrm{log GM}[Y_i | X_i = x + 1] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times x + \\beta_1$\n\n-   Interpretation of parameters by back-transforming model\n\n    -   Model: $\\textrm{GM}[Y_i | X_i] = e^{\\beta_0} \\times e^{\\beta_1 \\times X_i}$\n\n    -   When $X_i = 0$: $\\textrm{GM}[Y_i | X_i = 0] = e^{\\beta_0}$\n\n    -   When $X_i = x$: $\\textrm{GM}[Y_i | X_i = x] = e^{\\beta_0} \\times e^{\\beta_1 \\times x}$\n\n    -   When $X_i = x+1$: $\\textrm{GM}[Y_i | X_i = x + 1] = e^{\\beta_0} \\times e^{\\beta_1 \\times x} \\times e^{\\beta_1}$\n\n### Example: FEV with Height\n\n-   Question: How does FEV differ across height groups?\n\n-   Scientific justification for summarizing with geometric mean\n\n    -   FEV is a volume\n\n    -   Height is a linear dimension\n\n    -   Each dimension of lung size is proportional to height\n\n    -   Standard deviation is likely proportional to height\n\n    -   Science: $FEV \\propto Height^3$ or $\\sqrt[3]{FEV} \\propto Height$\n\n-   Statistics: $\\textrm{log}(FEV) \\propto 3 \\textrm{ log}(Height)$\n\n    -   Science dictates model choice\n\n-   Statistical preference for (any) transformations of response\n\n    -   May transform to equal variance across groups\n\n    -   Homoscedasticity allows for easier inference\n\n-   Statistical preference for a log transformation\n\n    -   Easier interpretation: multiplicative model\n\n    -   Compare groups using ratios\n\n### Log Transformed Predictors\n\n-   Interpretation of log predictor and log link for response\n\n-   Log link used to model the geometric mean of $Y$\n\n-   Exponentiated slope estimates ratio of geometric means across groups\n\n-   Log transformation of predictor compares groups with a $k$-fold difference in there measured predictors\n\n-   Estimated ratio of geometric means\n\n    -   $\\exp (\\textrm{log}(k) \\times \\beta_1) = k^{\\beta_1}$\n\n-   Interpretation of model\n\n    -   $\\textrm{log GM}[FEV_i | log (height_i)] = -11.9 + 3.12 \\times log(height_i)$\n\n-   Estimate ratio of geometric mean FEV for two groups differing by $10\\%$ in height (a 1.1 fold difference in height)\n\n-   To find: Exponentiate $1.1$ to the slope: $1.1^{3.12} = 1.35$\n\n    -   \"Group that is 10% taller is estimated to have a geometric mean FEV that is 1.35 times higher (35% higher)\"\n\n-   Why transform the predictor?\n\n    -   Typically chosen according to whether the data are likely to follow a straight line relationship\n\n    -   Linearity necessary to predict the values of the parameter in individual groups\n\n    -   Linearity is not necessary to estimate existence of an association\n\n    -   Linearity is not necessary to estimate a first order trend in the parameter across groups having the sampled distribution of the predictor\n\n    -   (Inference about these two questions will tend to be conservative if linearity does not hold)\n\n    -   Rarely do we know which transformation of the predictor provides the best linear fit\n\n    -   As always, there is significant danger in using the data to estimate the best transformation to use\n\n    -   If there is no association of any kind between the response and the predictor, a linear fit (with a zero slope) is correct\n\n    -   Trying to detect a transformation is thus an informal test for an association (multiple testing, which inflates type I error rate)\n\n    -   It is best to choose transformations of the predictor on scientific grounds\n\n    -   In practice, it is often true that mean functions are well approximated by a straight line over a small range of the data\n\n-   Example: In the FEV dataset, the logarithm of height is approximately linear over the range of heights sampled (look at the plot)\n\n-   We can often choose untransformed predictors when science would suggest a non-linear association\n\n-   Can have major advantages in interpreting the results of the analysis\n\n-   In the FEV example, it is far more natural to compare heights by difference than by ratios\n\n    -   We would rather characterize two children as differing by 4 inches in height rather than as the 44 inch child being 10% taller than the 40 inch child\n\n### Looking Ahead to Multivariable Models\n\n-   The relative importance of having the \"true\" transformation for a predictor depends on the statistical role\n\n    -   Predictor of Interest\n\n    -   Effect Modifiers\n\n    -   Confounders\n\n    -   Precision variables\n\n-   We treat these variables different when planning our analysis\n\n    -   Predictor of Interest (should be pre-specified)\n\n        -   In general, don't worry about modeling the exact association until you have even established an association (binary search)\n\n        -   Need to have a prespecified model for the POI\n\n        -   Searching for the best fit can inflate the type I error\n\n        -   Make most accurate, precise inference about the presence of the association first\n\n        -   Exploratory models can suggest models for future analyses\n\n    -   Effect Modifiers (difficult to do right anyway)\n\n        -   Modeling of effect modifiers is invariably just a test for the existence of an interaction\n\n        -   We rarely have a lot of precision to answer questions in subgroups of the data\n\n        -   Patterns of interaction can be so complex that it is unlikely that we will really capture the interactions across all subgroups in a single model\n\n        -   Typically, we would restrict future studies to analyses treating subgroups separately\n\n    -   Confounders (matters the most)\n\n        -   It is important to have an appropriate model of the association between the confounder and the response\n\n        -   Failure to accurately model the confounder means that some residual confounding will exist\n\n        -   However, searching for the best model may inflate the type I error for inference about the predictor of interest by overstating the precision of the study\n\n        -   Luckily, we rarely care about inference for the confounder, so we are free to use inefficient means of adjustment (e.g. a stratified analysis)\n\n    -   Precision Variables\n\n        -   When modeling precision variables, it is rarely worth the effort to use the \"best\" transformation\n\n        -   We usually capture the largest part of the added precision using crude models\n\n        -   We generally do not care about estimating association between the response and the precision variable\n\n            -   Most often, precision variables represent known effects on the response\n",
