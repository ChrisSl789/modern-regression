Sometimes, though, we are interested in how a risk factor or treatment affects time to disease or some other event. Or we may have study dropout, and therefore subjects who we are not sure if they had disease or not. In these cases, logistic regression is not appropriate.\n\nSurvival analysis is used to analyze data in which the time until the event is of interest. The response is often referred to as a failure time, survival time, or event time.\n\n### Examples\n\n-   Time from randomization until cardiovascular death after some treatment intervention\n\n-   Time from diagnosis until tumor recurrence\n\n-   Time from diagnosis until AIDS for HIV patients\n\n-   Time from production until a machine part fails\n\n-   Note that there needs to be a clearly defined starting and ending point\n\n### The survival time response\n\n-   Usually continuous\n-   May be incompletely determined for some subjects\n    -   i.e. For some subjects we may know that their survival time was at least equal to some time t. Whereas, for other subjects, we will know their exact time of event.\n-   Incompletely observed responses are *censored*\n-   Time is always $>0$\n\n### Analysis issues\n\n-   If there is no censoring, standard regression procedures could be used\n-   However, these may be inadequate because\n    -   Time to event is restricted to be positive and has a skewed distribution.\n    -   The probability of surviving past a certain point in time may be of more interest than the expected time of event. Linear regression models means.\n    -   A multiplicative model for the hazard may be a better fit\n    -   May desire an interpretation that is similar to a relative risk\n\n### Censoring\n\nCensoring is present when we have some information about a subject's event time, but we don't know the exact event time. For the analysis methods we will discuss to be valid, censoring mechanism must be independent of the survival mechanism.\n\nThere are generally three reasons why censoring might occur:\n\n-   A subject does not experience the event before the study ends\n-   A person is lost to follow-up during the study period\n-   A person withdraws from the study\n\nThese are all examples of right-censoring.\n\n![Trial Anatomy](figures/trial_anatomy.png)\n\n> RICH JT, NEELY JG, PANIELLO RC, VOELKER CCJ, NUSSENBAUM B, WANG EW.

But we know something about them - that they were each followed for a certain amount of time without the event of interest prior to being censored.\n\n*Survival analysis techniques provide a way to appropriately account for censored patients in the analysis.*\n\n### Types of right-censoring\n\n-   Fixed type I censoring occurs when a study is designed to end after C years of follow-up. In this case, everyone who does not have an event observed during the course of the study is censored at C years.\n-   In random type I censoring, the study is designed to end after C years, but censored subjects do not all have the same censoring time. This is the main type of right-censoring we will be concerned with.\n-   In type II censoring, a study ends when there is a pre- specified number of events.\n\nRegardless of the type of censoring, we must assume that it is non-informative about the event; that is, the censoring is caused by something other than the impending failure.\n\n### Terminology and notation\n\n-   $T$ denotes the response variable, $T > 0$\n-   The survival function is\n\n$$\nS(t) = \\textrm{Pr}(T > t) = 1− F(t)\n$$\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(function(t) exp(-2*t), 0, 2, ylab=\"Survival\", xlab=\"Time (years)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example survival function.  Survival is 1 at time 0 and decreases over time.](Lec08.Survival_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n-   All subjects are at risk (and event free) at time 0. Thus, the survival estimate at 0 is always 1\n-   Survival decreases over time. If we observe for a long enough period of time, survival eventually decreases to 0.\n-   The survival function gives the probability that a subject will survive past time t.\n-   Specifically, as t ranges from 0 to $\\infty$, the survival function has the following properties\n    -   It is non-increasing\n\n    -   At time t = 0, S(t) = 1. In other words, the probability of surviving past time 0 is 1.\n\n    -   At time $t = \\infty$, $S(t) = S(\\infty) = 0$. As time goes to infinity, the survival curve goes to 0.\n-   In theory, the survival function is smooth. In practice, we observe events on a discrete time scale (days, weeks, etc.)\n\n#### Hazard, cumulative hazard, and survival\n\n-   The hazard function, h(t), is the instantaneous rate at which events occur, given no previous events. $$\n    h(t) = \\lim_{{\\Delta t} \\to 0} \\frac{P(t \\leq T < t + \\Delta t | T \\geq t)}{\\Delta t}\n    $$\n\n-   $T$ is a random variable denoting the time until the event (for example, failure or death) occurs. The numerator in the fraction is the conditional probability that the event occurs in the small time interval $[t, t + Δt]$ given that it has not occurred before time $t$. The denominator $\\Delta t$ is the length of this time interval. As $\\Delta t$ goes to 0, this ratio gives the instantaneous rate of occurrence of the event at time $t$, which is the hazard function $h(t)$.\n\n-   The cumulative hazard\n\n$$\nH(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} h(u) du\n$$\n\n-   Here, h(u) is the hazard function and u is the variable of integration. This integral represents the accumulated risk of the event (for example, failure or death) over the time interval $[0, t]$.\n\n-   The relationship between the survival function $S(t)$ and the cumulative hazard function $H(t)$\n\n$$\nS(t) = \\exp(-H(t))\n$$\n\n-   Key point: Survival function, cumulative hazard function, and hazard function are interconnected. If we know any one of the functions $S(t)$, $H(t)$, or $h(t)$, we can derive the other two functions.\n\n#### Outcome definition\n\n-   To analyze survival data, we need to know the observed time $Y_i$ and the event indicator $\\delta_i$. For subject $i$:\n\n-   Observed time $Y_i = \\min(T_i, C_i)$ where $T_i$ = event time and $C_i$ = censoring time\n\n-   Event indicator $\\delta_i$ = 1 if event observed (i.e. $T_i \\leq C_i$), = 0 if censored (i.e. $T_i > C_i$)\n\n## Non-parametric estimation of the survival curve\n\n-   In theory the survival function is smooth; in practice we observe events on a discrete time scale.\n\n-   The **survival probability** at a certain time, $S(t)$, is a conditional probability of surviving beyond that time, given that an individual has survived just prior to that time. The survival probability can be estimated as the number of patients who are alive without loss to follow-up at that time, divided by the number of patients who were alive just prior to that time.\n\n-   The **Kaplan-Meier** estimate of survival probability at a given time is the product of these conditional probabilities up until that given time\n\n$$\n\\hat{S}(t) = \\prod_{i: t_i \\leq t} (1 - \\frac{d_i}{n_i})\n$$\n\n-   $\\hat{S}(t)$ is the estimated survival function at time (t),\n-   $t_i$ are the observed event times,\n-   $d_i$ is the number of events (e.g. deaths) at time ($t_i$),\n-   $n_i$ is the number of individuals known to have survived (are at risk) up to time ($t_i$).\n\n### Example: The `lung` dataset\n\nThe `lung` dataset is available from the {survival} package. The data contain subjects with advanced lung cancer from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. We will focus on the following variables throughout this tutorial:\n\n-   time: Observed survival time in days\n-   status: censoring status 1=censored, 2=dead\n-   sex: 1=Male, 2=Female\n\n*Note that the status is coded in a non-standard way in this dataset. Typically you will see 1=event, 0=censored*. Let's recode it to avoid confusion:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlung <- \n  lung %>% \n  mutate(\n    status = recode(status, `1` = 0, `2` = 1)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow we have:\n\n-   time: Observed survival time in days\n-   status: censoring status 0=censored, 1=dead\n-   sex: 1=Male, 2=Female\n\nHere are the first 6 observations:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(lung[, c(\"time\", \"status\", \"sex\")])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n---------------------\n time   status   sex \n------ -------- -----\n 306      1       1  \n\n 455      1       1  \n\n 1010     0       1  \n\n 210      1       1  \n\n 883      1       1  \n\n 1022     0       1  \n---------------------\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n*Note*: the `Surv()` function in the {survival} package accepts by default TRUE/FALSE, where TRUE is event and FALSE is censored; 1/0 where 1 is event and 0 is censored; or 2/1 where 2 is event and 1 is censored. **Please take care to ensure the event indicator is properly formatted.**\n\n### Creating survival objects and curves\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier method is the most common way to estimate survival times and probabilities. It is a non-parametric approach that results in a step function, where there is a step down each time an event occurs.\n\nThe `Surv()` function from the {survival} package creates a survival object for use as the response in a model formula. There will be one entry for each subject that is the survival time, which is followed by a `+` if the subject was censored. Let's look at the first 10 observations:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSurv(lung$time, lung$status)[1:10]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1]  306   455  1010+  210   883  1022+  310   361   218   166 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe see that subject 1 had an event at time 306 days, subject 2 had an event at time 455 days, subject 3 was censored at time 1010 days, etc.\n\nThe `survfit()` function creates survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method based on a formula. Let's generate the overall survival curve for the entire cohort, assign it to object `s1`, and look at the structure using `str()`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns1 <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung)\nstr(s1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nList of 16\n $ n        : int 228\n $ time     : num [1:186] 5 11 12 13 15 26 30 31 53 54 ...\n $ n.risk   :

Here \"naive\" means that the patients who were censored prior to 1-year are considered event-free and included in the denominator.\n\n121 of the 228 patients in the `lung` data died by $1$ year so the \"naive\" estimate is calculated as:\n\n$$\\Big(1 - \\frac{121}{228}\\Big) \\times 100 = 47\\%$$ You get an **incorrect** estimate of the $1$-year probability of survival when you ignore the fact that 42 patients were censored before $1$ year.\n\nRecall the **correct** estimate of the $1$-year probability of survival, accounting for censoring using the Kaplan-Meier method, was 41%.\n\nIgnoring censoring leads to an **overestimate** of the overall survival probability. Imagine two studies, each with 228 subjects. There are 165 deaths in each study. Censoring is ignored in one , censoring is accounted for in the other. The censored subjects only contribute information for a portion of the follow-up time, and then fall out of the risk set, thus pulling down the cumulative probability of survival. Ignoring censoring erroneously treats patients who are censored as part of the risk set for the entire follow-up period.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lec08.Survival_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Estimating median survival time\n\nAnother quantity often of interest in a survival analysis is the average survival time, which we quantify using the median.

It is bounded by $\\infty$.\n\n    -   Survival is a function of the cumulative hazard. Survival is 1 at time 0 and decreases over time. It is bounded by $0$ and $1$.\n\n    -   For a dichotomous predictor variable (X is 0 or 1), the proportional hazards assumption is that $\\lambda_1 (t) = e^{\\beta_1} \\lambda_0 (t)$\n\n        -   In the plots I illustrated $e^{\\beta_1} = 1.5$ ($\\beta_1 = 0.4054$).\n\n        -   On the hazard scale, this corresponds to $\\lambda_1(t)$ always being $1.5$ times larger than $\\lambda_0(t)$.\n\n        -   On the log hazard scale, this corresponds to $log(\\lambda_1(t))$ always being $log(1.5) = 0.4054$ units larger than $log(\\lambda_0(t))$.\n\n        -   The proportional hazards assumption is the \"parametric\" part of the Cox proportional hazards model. Hence, the Cox proportional hazards model is referred to as being \"semi-parametric\".\n\n### Software\n\n-   Stata commands\n\n    -   \"stset time event-indicator\"\n\n    -   \"stcox predictor, \\[robust\\]\"\n\n-   R functions\n\n    -   \"Surv(time, event-indicator)\"\n\n    -   \"coxph(Surv(time, event-indicator) \\~ predictor)\"\n\n    -   There is a robust option in coxph for calcluating robust standard error estimates.

Note that other functions for fitting Cox models in R may or may not have this functionality.\n\n\"From proportional hazards regression analysis, we estimate that for each 1 ng/ml unit difference in nadir PSA, this risk of relapse is $1.6\\%$ higher in the group with the higher nadir PSA. This estimate is highly statistically significant ($p < 0.001$). A 95% CI suggests that this observation is not unusual if a group that has a 1 ng/ml higher nadir PSA might have risk of relapse that was anywhere from $0.9\\%$ higher to $2.3\\%$ higher than the group with lower nadir PSA.\"\n\n### Inference with PH Regression\n\n-   The ideas of Signal and Noise found in simple linear regression do not translate well to PH regression\n\n    -   We do not tend to quantify an error distribution with PH regression\n\n-   Valid statistical inference (CIs, p-values) about *associations* requires three general assumptions\n\n    -   Assumptions about approximately Normal distributions for the parameter estimates\n\n        -   Large N\n\n            -   Need for either robust standard errors or classical regression\n\n            -   Definition of large depends on the underlying probability distribution\n\n    -   Assumptions about independence of observations\n\n        -   Classical regression: Independence of all observation\n\n        -   Robust standard errors: Correlated observations within identified clusters\n\n    -   Assumptions about variance of observations within groups\n\n        -   Classical regression: Mean-variance relationship for binary data\n\n            -   Proportional hazards considers the hazard of event at every time\n\n            -   Hence in order to satisfy this requirement, need proportional hazards and linearity of predictor\n\n        -   Robust standard errors\n\n            -   Allows unequal variance across groups\n\n            -   Hence, do not need linearity of predictor or proportional hazards\n\n-   Valid statistical inference (CIs, p-values) about *hazard of response in specific groups* requires a further assumption\n\n    -   Assumption about the adequacy of the linear model\n\n        -   If we are trying to borrow information about the log hazards from neighboring groups, and we are assuming a straight line relationship, the straight line needs to be true\n\n        -   Needed for either classical or robust standard errors\n\n        -   Note that we can model transformations of the measured predictor\n\n-   We rarely make inference about within group survival probabilities using the proportional hazards model\n\n    -   Sometimes estimated survival curves are used descriptively\n\n        -   Use estimates of the baseline survival function\n\n        -   Exponentiate the baseline survival to find survival curve for specific covariate patterns\n\n-   Relationship to survival\n\n    -   Hazard function determines the survival function.\n\n    -   For the Cox model\n\n        |                   |                                                                                              |\n        |:-------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|\n        | Hazard            | $\\lambda(t | X_i) = \\lambda_{0}(t) \\times e^{\\beta_1 \\times X_i}$                            |\n        | Cumulative Hazard | $\\Lambda(t | X_i) = \\displaystyle\\int^t_0 \\lambda_{0}(u) \\times e^{\\beta_1 \\times X_i} \\ du$ |\n        | Survival Function | $S(t | X_i) = e^{-\\Lambda(t|X_i)} = [S_0(t)]^{e^{\\beta_1 \\times X_i}}$                       |\n\n#### Log-transformed nadir PSA\n\n-   Suppose that you know based on prior experience or consultation with collaborators...\n\n    -   A constant difference in PSA would not be expected to confer the same increased risk\n\n        -   Comparing 4 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml is not the same as comparing 104 ng/ml to 110 ng/ml\n\n    -   A multiplicative effect on risk might be better\n\n        -   Same increase in risk for each doubling of nadir PSA\n\n        -   Achieve this model by using log transformed nadir PSA\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npsa$lognadirpsa <- log(psa$nadirpsa)\nm2 <- coxph(Surv(obstime, relapse) ~ lognadirpsa, data=psa, robust=TRUE)\nm2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     &nbsp;

We are 95% confident the true hazard ratio is between a 1.16 and 1.91 fold increase. Since the hazard ratio does not contain 1, males are at a significantly increased hazard of death compared to females.\n\nComparing males to females, males have a median (or any other quantile) survival times that is 0.673 times the median (or other quantile) survival time in females. We are 95% confident that the true acceleration factor is between 0.52 and 0.85.\n\nThe statements are more awkward when the acceleration factor is less than 1. We could flip the estimates (e.g $0.673^{-1}$) and say that the median (or other quantile) survival time in females is 1.49 times longer than it is in males to be less awkward.\n\n-   Note that a hazard ratio greater than one is harmful for survival while an acceleration factor greater than one is beneficial for survival. One is the null values for both interpretations.\n\n### Other parametric models\n\n-   Example shown here focused on a Weibull model as an introduction. We identified the Exponential distribution (a special case of the Weibull) is not a good fit.\n\n-   Other (parametric) distributions are possible. Some have a proportional hazards interpretation (only) or an accelerated failure time interpretation (only). Other lack either of these interpretations, but are more flexible in how they model the hazard function. There is a trade-off between interpretability and flexibility.\n\n-   Goal is to pick a distribution with a corresponding hazard (cumulative hazard) that is appropriate model for your data, will be reproducible, and is ultimately interpretable.\n\n-   Cox model is a good choice if you want to model associations and not concern yourself with the shape of the hazard function. This is a very common situation and why the Cox model is widely used.\n\n-   If goal is prediction, appropriate parametric models (perhaps with additional flexibility) may outperform the Cox model\n\n\n## Bayesian Time to Event Models\n\n\n-   Bayesian approaches to fitting survival models are often based on parametric approaches or approaches that attempt to mimic the Cox model\n\n    -   It is relatively straight forward to fit Bayesian models using parametric distributions like Weibull\n\n    -   Models that attempt to recreate a Cox-like models are more complex because it can be difficult to recreate the flexibility of the baseline hazard function needed\n    \n    \n### Review: Bayesian Analysis\n\n* The Bayesian Paradigm provides a framework for incorporating prior knowledge with observed data through the use of probability models. In this approach:\n\n-   **Posterior distribution** is obtained by combining:\n    1.  The **Likelihood**: $L(\\mathbf{\\theta}; \\mathbf{x})$, representing the probability of the observed data $\\mathbf{x}$ given the model parameters $\\mathbf{\\theta}$.\n    2.  The **Prior Distribution**: $\\pi(\\mathbf{\\theta})$, reflecting prior beliefs or information about $\\mathbf{\\theta}$.\n\n* Mathematically, the posterior distribution is expressed as:\n\n$$\np(\\mathbf{\\theta} \\mid \\text{data}) \\propto L(\\mathbf{\\theta}; \\mathbf{x}) \\cdot \\pi(\\mathbf{\\theta})\n$$\n\n* This illustrates the key Bayesian principle: beliefs about $\\mathbf{\\theta}$ (the **posterior distribution**) are updated by combining new evidence (the **likelihood**) with prior knowledge (the **prior distribution**).\n\n### Review: Linear Regression\n\n* The Bayesian paradigm can be applied to the linear regression model, where the parameters of interest, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma)$, consist of:\n\n   -   $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$: The regression coefficients (bold to emphasize their vector nature).\n   -   $\\sigma$: The standard deviation of the residuals, representing the variability not explained by the model.\n\n#### Likelihood\n\n* In classical linear regression, the **Likelihood** $L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; \\mathbf{x})$ is modeled as a Normal distribution with mean $\\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, where $\\mathbf{X}$ is the design matrix of predictors.\n\n* The likelihood can be expressed as a product of individual likelihoods for each data point $i$, given by:\n\n$$\nL(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; \\mathbf{x}) = \\prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; \\mathbf{x}_i)\n$$\n\n* For classical linear regression (assuming a Normal distribution) this becomes:\n\n$$\nL(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X}) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} \\exp \\left( -\\frac{(y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right)\n$$\n\n-   $y_i$: Observed outcome for the $i$-th data point\n-   $\\mathbf{x}_i^T$: Row vector of predictors for the $i$-th data point.\n-   $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$: Coefficients for the predictors\n-   $\\sigma^2$: Variance of the residuals.\n\n#### Prior Distributions\n\nIn the Bayesian framework, prior distributions are assigned to the parameters of interest to reflect prior beliefs or knowledge about their values before observing the data. For Bayesian linear regression, typical priors (but not the only priors) include:\n\n-   **For** $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$: A multivariate Normal distribution: $$\n    \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_\\beta, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_\\beta)\n    $$ where $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_\\beta$ is the mean vector and $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_\\beta$ is the covariance matrix, encoding the prior beliefs about $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$.\n\n-   **For** $\\sigma$: An exponential distribution: $$\n    \\pi(\\sigma) \\sim \\text{Exponential}(\\lambda)\n    $$ where $\\lambda$ is a rate parameter. In **rstanarm** and **stan_glm**, $\\lambda$ is weakly informative and scaled based on the data, often reflecting the standard deviation of the outcome variable.\n\n#### Posterior distribution\n\n* These priors, combined with the likelihood, form the basis for the posterior distribution, which is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the priors.\n\n* This model encodes several key assumptions:\n\n   1 **Linearity**: The relationship between the predictors and the outcome is linear, expressed as the expected value $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$.\n\n   2 **Homoskedasticity**: The variance of the residuals $\\text{Var}(\\varepsilon_i) = \\sigma^2$ is constant across all levels of the predictors.\n\n   3 **Normality of the residuals**: $\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$\n\n### Review: Logistic Regression\n\n* The Bayesian Paradigm can be applied to the logistic regression model, where the parameters of interest are $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$,\n\n* In logistic regression, the Bayesian approach models the probability of a binary outcome $y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ as a function of the predictors $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and the regression coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. The likelihood for the observed data is expressed as:\n\n$$\nL(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}; \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X}) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( \\pi_i \\right)^{y_i} \\left( 1 - \\pi_i \\right)^{1 - y_i}\n$$\n\n\n* $\\pi_i = \\text{logit}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta})}{1 + \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta})}$\n* $y_i$: Observed binary outcome for the $i$-th data point.\n* $\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top$: Row vector of predictors for the $i$-th data point. \n* $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$: Regression coefficients.\n\nThis likelihood serves as the basis for updating the posterior distribution when combined with appropriate prior distributions on $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$.\n\n\n* See [Logistic Regression Notes](Lec04.Logistic.qmd#sec-bayeslogistic) for additional details\n\n\n### Bayesian Parametric Survival Analysis\n\n\n* The Bayesian approach to parametric survival models follow a similar procedure to linear and logistic regression\n\n   * A likelihood is specified based on the assumed underlying probability distribution\n   \n   \n   * Prior distributions are specified for the parameters in the model\n   \n   * The posterior distribution is updated combining the likelihood and the prior\n\n\n#### Example: Weibull model, Bayesian approach\n\n* Suppose we assume a Weibull distribution for survival time.  The parameters of interest, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, typically include:\n\n   * $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$: Regression coefficients for covariates (bold to emphasize their vector nature) to impact the scale parameter of the Weibull distribution\n\n   * $p$: Shape parameter of the Weibull distribution.\n\nThe likelihood for the observed survival data $(t_i, \\delta_i)$ is expressed as:\n\n$$\nL(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; \\mathbf{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\delta}) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left[h(t_i; \\lambda, p)^{\\delta_i} \\cdot S(t_i; \\lambda, p)^{1 - \\delta_i}\\right],\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n* $t_i$: Survival time for the $i$-th individual.\n\n* $\\delta_i$: Censoring indicator, where $\\delta_i = 1$ if the event is observed and $\\delta_i = 0$ if the data is censored.\n\n* $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$: Vectors of survival times and censoring indicators.\n\n* $\\lambda = \\exp(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$: Scale parameter is modeled as a function of covariates\n\n#### Prior Distributions\n\n* In the Bayesian framework, prior distributions are assigned to the model parameters:\n- **For $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$**: A multivariate Normal distribution:\n  $$\n  \\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_\\beta, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_\\beta),\n  $$\n  where $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_\\beta$ is the mean vector and $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_\\beta$ is the covariance matrix.\n  \n- **For $p$**: Weakly informative prior, such as Gamma distributions or other appropriate priors based on prior knowledge.\n\n* These priors combined with the likelihood provide the posterior distribution used for inference.\n\n\n### Bayesian Cox-type Models for Time to Event Data\n\n- There is no direct analog of the Cox model in the Bayesian paradigm.  The reason for this relates to the partial likelihood.\n\n- Cox models are estimated by maximizing the partial likelihood, which does not include the baseline hazard function\n\nThe partial likelihood for the Cox model is given by:\n\n$$\nL_p(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\prod_{i:\\delta_i=1} h_0(t_i) \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\Bigg/ \\sum_{j \\in R(t_i)} h_0(t_i) \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_j^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta}),\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n* $h_0(t_i)$: Baseline hazard function at time $t_i$.\n\n* $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$: Regression coefficients.\n\n* $\\mathbf{x}_i$: Covariates for the $i$-th individual.\n\n* $R(t_i)$: Risk set at time $t_i$, i.e., individuals still at risk just before time $t_i$.\n\nThe baseline hazard cancels out, so the partial likelihood simplifies to:\n\n$$\nL_p(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\prod_{i:\\delta_i=1} \\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta})}{\\sum_{j \\in R(t_i)} \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_j^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta})}.\n$$\n\n* Key point: In a frequentist analysis, $\\beta$ is maximized irrespective of the baseline hazard\n\n* In a Bayesian analysis, the unspecified baseline hazard function $h_0(t)$ cannot be ignored.  An additional approach is required to estimate the baseline hazard alongside $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. \n\n* Methods often involve modeling the baseline hazard explicitly, such as using splines or piecewise constant functions.  Alternatively, latent processes can allow flexible modeling and full Bayesian inference.\n\n   1. **Piecewise Exponential Model**: The time axis is divided into predefined intervals, and the baseline hazard is assumed to be constant within each interval. This approach offers flexibility while maintaining computational simplicity.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nplot_data <- data.frame(\n  from_time = seq(0, 4, by = 1),\n  to_time = seq(1, 5, by = 1),\n  hazard = c(0.5, 1, 1.5, 0.8, 0.3)\n)\nggplot(plot_data) + geom_segment(aes(x = from_time, xend = to_time, y = hazard, yend = hazard))  +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Time\",\n    y = \"Hazard\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  ylim(0,1.6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Piecewise Exponential Hazard Function](Lec08.Survival_files/figure-html/fig-piecewise-exponential-1.png){#fig-piecewise-exponential width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n   2. **Spline-Based Methods**: The baseline hazard is modeled using splines, such as cubic splines or B-splines, allowing for a smooth and flexible representation of the hazard function over time.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(splines)\n\n# Define time points and a base positive hazard function (example)\ntime_points <- seq(0, 5, length.out = 100)\nbase_hazard <- abs(0.5 + 0.3 * time_points - 0.1 * time_points^2)  # Ensure hazards are positive\nnoise <- abs(rnorm(length(time_points), mean = 0, sd = 0.05))  # Add positive noise\nhazard_values <- base_hazard + noise\n\n# Fit a cubic spline to the hazard function\nspline_fit <- smooth.spline(time_points, hazard_values)\n\n# Create data for plotting the spline\nspline_data <- data.frame(\n  time = spline_fit$x,\n  hazard = spline_fit$y\n)\n\n# Plot the spline-based hazard function\nggplot(data = spline_data, aes(x = time, y = hazard)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Time\",\n    y = \"Hazard\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ylim(0, NA)  # Set y-axis lower bound to 0\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Spline-Based Hazard Function](Lec08.Survival_files/figure-html/fig-spline-hazard-1.png){#fig-spline-hazard width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n   3. **Dirichlet Process Priors**: The baseline hazard is modeled nonparametrically using a Dirichlet process prior. This approach provides flexibility in estimating the hazard function by letting the data inform its shape, while still incorporating prior beliefs.\n\n   4. **Others**: Machine learning and other approaches\n\n\n### R-Related Software for Bayesian Survival Analysis\n\nThere are several R packages that support Bayesian survival analysis.\n\n- **`stan_surv` in `rstanarm`**:\n\n   * This function implements Bayesian survival analysis using flexible parametric models.
