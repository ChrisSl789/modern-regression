Typically, dose of some treatment. Higher doses presumed to lead to greater (or lesser) response.\n-   Exposure. Typically, greater precision (more power) to consider amount of exposure rather than just Exposed versus Unexposed\n-   Many others. Age, serum cholesterol, blood pressure, height, etc.\n-   \"Dose-response\" in the following notes that follow more generally refers to \"doses\" of any type of continuous covariate (\"doses of age\", \"doses of cholesterol\", etc.)\n\n### Scientific questions when modeling dose-response\n\n-   We have many choices for modeling dose-response\n\n-   Consider the scientific question when deciding on an appropriate model\n\n-   How does the scientific question you want to answer relate to how you model the dose-response relationship?\n\n    -   Models for detecting an association in subgroups defined by $X$\n    -   Models for estimating the mean response in subgroups defined by $X$\n    -   Models for predicting individual response in subgroups defined by $X$\n\n-   Will describe methods for\n\n    -   Modeling complex dose-response curves\n\n    -   Flexible methods (non-parametric loess smooths, parameteric regression splines)\n\n## Hierarchical Models\n\n### Full and restricted models\n\n-   When testing for associations, we are implicitly comparing two models\n\n    -   \"Full\" model\n\n        -   Usually corresponds to alternative hypothesis\n\n        -   Contains all terms in the \"restricted\" model plus some terms that we want to test for inclusion\n\n        -   Example: $g(\\theta) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * X_1 + \\beta_2 * X_2$\n\n    -   \"Restricted\" model\n\n        -   Usually corresponds to the null hypothesis\n\n        -   Terms in the model are the subset of the terms in the full model that are not being tested\n\n        -   Example: $g(\\theta) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * X_1$\n\n    -   Jargon: The restricted model is \"nested\" in the full model\n\n        -   If we set some parameters in the full model equal to zero, we will get the restricted model\n\n        -   We have very good methods for testing differences between nested models\n\n            -   Is a model with weight and height as predictors better than a model with just weight?\n\n        -   Our methods are not as good for comparing models that are not nested\n\n            -   Is a model with just weight as a predictor better than a model with just height as a predictor?\n\n    -   Non-nested models (e.g. $X_1$ is weight, $X_2$ is height)\n\n        -   $g(\\theta) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * X_1$\n\n        -   $g(\\theta) = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_2 * X_2$\n\n### Scientific interpretation of full versus restricted models\n\n-   Our scientific interpretation of our statistical tests depends on the meaning of the restricted model compared to the full model\n\n    -   Consider the the additional associations that are possible with the full model that are not possible with the restricted model\n\n-   Appears very straightforward when we are only considering one full model compared to one restricted model\n\n    -   In practice, we may have many restricted models in mind\n\n    -   Multiple testing problem appears if we are considering many restricted models\n\n#### Example 1: Adjusted effects\n\n-   Full model: FEV vs smoking, age, height\n\n-   Restricted model: FEV vs age, height\n\n-   If the full model provides no clear advantage over the restricted model, then we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to suggest an association between FEV and smoking when controlling for age and height\n\n-   Note how carefully I stated the above\n\n    -   \"Insufficient evidence\" (not evidence that smoking is not associated)\n\n    -   Conditional on controlling for age and height. Smoking, alone, may be an important predictor of FEV. The question answered by the full and reduced model is a comparison of FEV \"among individuals of the same age and height but differing in smoking status\" not just individuals who differ in smoking status.\n\n#### Example 2: Tests of linearity\n\n-   Full model: Survival vs cholesterol and cholesterol$^2$\n\n    -   Linear and quadratic terms for cholesterol\n\n    -   Model allows for a parabolic shape for chelesterol\n\n-   Restricted model: Survival vs cholesterol\n\n-   If the full model provides no clear advantage over the restricted model, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to suggest a U-shaped trend in survival with cholesterol\n\n-   Note that a quadratic term does not include all possibilities for non-linearity. We will cover other (better) approaches later in the notes\n\n### Statistical comparison of full and reduced models\n\n-   Wald test\n\n    -   Fits only the full model\n\n    -   Tests if the parameter (or parameters) in the full model are equal to zero\n\n    -   Can be used for robust and non-robust standard error estimates (fit using GEE)\n\n-   Likelihood Ratio test\n\n    -   Fits both the full and reduced model\n\n    -   Compares the likelihood functions to determine if they are significantly different\n\n    -   Can be used for non-robust models only (fit using likelihood)\n\n-   Score test\n\n    -   Only fits the reduced model\n\n    -   Considers the gradient of the likelihood function. After fitting the reduced model, looks at what is left over to see if it can be predicted by additional covariates\n\n    -   Not generally reported in regression model setting, but some common tests are Score tests (e.g. log-rank test)\n\n-   In large samples, the Wald, Likelihood Ratio, and Score tests converge\n\n    -   Given our focus on robust standard error estimates, we have used Wald tests almost exclusively\n\n### Models with interactions (effect modification)\n\n-   Models to test for effect modification (interactions) are hierarchical\n\n    -   Full Model: Include the interactions\n\n    -   Reduced Model: Set the interactions to be tested in the full model to zero\n\n-   Best scientific approach is to pre-specify the statistical model that will be used for analysis\n\n-   Sometimes we choose a relatively large model including interactions\n\n    -   Allows us to address more questions (e.g. effect modification)\n\n    -   Sometimes gives greater precision\n\n        -   Trade-offs between more parameters to estimate versus smaller within group variability\n\n-   Deciding which parameters to test from the full model\n\n    -   It can be difficult to decide the statistical test that corresponds to specific scientific questions\n\n    -   Need to consider the restricted model that corresponds to your null hypothesis\n\n        -   Which parameters in the full model need to be set to zero to test your desired hypothesis\n\n#### Examples of different scientific tests from the same full model\n\n-   In the following examples, the full model is the same but we change the restricted model based on the scientific question\n\n    -   Full model: Survival vs sex, smoking, sex-smoking interaction\n\n    -   Example Question 1: Is there effect modification?\n\n        -   Restricted model: Survival vs sex and smoking\n\n            -   Test that the sex-smoking interaction is zero\n\n    -   Example question 2: Is there an association between survival and sex?\n\n        -   Restricted model: Survival vs smoking\n\n            -   Test that parameters for sex and sex-smoking interaction are zero\n\n            -   Does sex effect survival in either smokers or non-smokers?\n\n    -   Example question 3: Is there an association between survival and smoking?\n\n        -   Restricted model: Survival vs sex\n\n            -   Test that parameters for smoking and sex-smoking interaction are zero\n\n#### Be careful when making data-driven model building decisions\n\n-   We are often tempted to remove parameters that are not statistically significant before proceeding to other tests\n\n    -   You will find many textbooks that advocate using this analysis approach\n\n        -   e.g. fit the interaction, if it is not significant, exclude it from the model\n\n        -   Such texts are invariable written by mathematicians with no understanding of the underlying science\n\n        -   When you work in the same scientific area, you will eventually \"discover\" false-positive assocations if you use this model building technique\n\n    -   Such data-driven analyses tend to suggest that failure to reject the null means equivalence\n\n        -   But, if you make this conclusion, you are wrong (large p-values do not indicate equivalence)\n        \n        -   Abscence of evidence is not evidence of abscence\n\n    -   A procedure where we fit one model, and then use the results to determine the next model we will fit tends to underestimate the true standard error\n\n        -   A consequence of the genearl multiple testing problem\n\n        -   Will lead to declaring statistical significance more often than you should (inflates type-I error rate)\n\n        -   May also lead to parameter estimates that are biased away from the null\n\n            -   Statistical significance increases as a function of the effect size and the inverse of the standard error\n\n            -   If, by chance, you see a large effect in your sample, you will be more likely to declare significance\n\n-   How we interpret \"negative\" studies\n\n    -   There are other many reasons for not rejecting the null hypothesis of zero slope\n\n        -   There may be no association\n\n        -   There may be an association, but not in the parameter considered (i.e. the mean response)\n\n        -   There may be an association in the parameter considered, but the best fitting line has zero slope (a curvilinear association in the parameter)\n\n        -   There may be a first order trend in the parameter, but we lack sufficient statistical precision to be confident that it truly exists (a type-II error)\n\n    -   Be careful to not just assume that it the first reason, no association\n\n    -   Statistically, there is no way of discriminating between these four possibilities unless you have an infinite sample size\n\n## Modeling Complex Dose-Response\n\n![All models are wrong, but some are useful.](figures/quote-all-models-are-approximations-essentially-all-models-are-wrong-but-some-are-useful-however-george-e-p-box-98-93-58.jpg)\n\n### S-Shaped dose-response curves\n\n-   It is common in biology, medicine, and science to find \"S-shaped\" dose-response curves\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1234)\nn <- 100\nplotdata <- data.frame(x=1:n,\n                       y=20 + 50 / (1+exp(-.15*(1:n-50))))\nplotdata$y <- plotdata$y + rnorm(n,0,4)\nggplot(plotdata, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + geom_smooth()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![S-shaped dose response curve fit with loess smoother](Lec11.DoseResponse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   If we happen to sample over the entire range of $X$ (in this example, from 0 to 100), we will would observe all parts of the S-curve\n\n-   However, if we were only to sample from a limited range of $X$, we might observe only parts of the curve where it was approximately linear\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplotdata$xint <- cut(plotdata$x, c(0,30,70,100))\nggplot(plotdata, aes(x=x, y=y)) + facet_wrap(~ xint) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + geom_smooth()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The S-shaped dose response curve fit is approximately linear within three ranges of X.](Lec11.DoseResponse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Even if we expect a complex dose response relationship, we must also consider the range of dose that we are sampling over when considering the needed complexity of the model\n\n\n#### Loess smoothing\n\n  * The default smooth for 'geom_smooth' when there are fewer than 1000 data points is a loess smooth.  These fits appear in the plots above\n  \n  * Loess is a non-parametric smooth where fitting is done locally.\n  \n  * That is, for the fit at point x, the fit is made using points in a neighborhood of x, weighted by their distance from x\n  \n  * There are arguments to control the degree of smoothing, or how close we consider points to be in the \"neighborhood of x\"\n  \n  * 'loess' provides a nice visual representation to variety of data without having to specify a model\n  \n  * We will primarily be concerned with parametric smoothers as the parameters can be estimated (and in special cases interpreted) from multivariable regression models\n\n### Linear predictors\n\n-   The most commonly-used regression models all consider \"linear predictors\"\n\n    -   Linear refers to linear in the parameters ($\\beta$s), and is not a reference to transformations of the predictors\n\n    -   The modeled predictors can be transformations of the scientific measurements and still be linear (in the parameters).  These models are linear (in the parameters)\n\n        -   $g[\\theta | X_i] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\textrm{log}(X_i)$\n\n        -   $g[\\theta | X_i] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\beta_2 X_i^2$\n\n    -   Examples of models that are *not* linear in the parameters (We do not consider such models)\n\n        -   $g[\\theta | X_i] = \\beta_0 X_i^{\\beta_1}$\n\n        -   $g[\\theta | X_i] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\textrm{exp}(-\\beta_2 X_i)$\n\n        -   $g[\\theta | X_i] = \\frac{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i}{1 + \\beta_2 X_i}$\n\n### Types of transformations\n\n-   We transform predictors to provide more flexible description of complex associations between the response and some scientific measure\n\n    -   Threshold effects\n\n    -   Exponentially increasing effects\n\n    -   U-shaped functions\n\n    -   S-shaped functions\n\n    -   etc.\n    \n-   Flexible modeling of continuous predictors was briefly covered in the notes on Poisson regression.

  Predicted values of height at non-integer values of age (e.g. age of 18.5) may not make sense\n\n    -   Polynomials become especially unstable near the upper and lower bounds of the age distribution. Stability near the upper and lower bounds is a general concern in many spline approaches.\n\n-   A polynomial of lesser degree could also be considered.

In particular, compare to linear splines, they are no abrupt changes in the slope at each knot point.\n\n-   There are various types of polynomial splines, each with different formulas applied to generate the basis matrix for the regression model\n\n    -   B-spline: 'bs()'\n        -   Representing the family of piecewise polynomials with the specified interior knots and degree\n    -   Natural Cubic spline 'ns()'\n        -   Enforce the constraint that the function is linear beyond the boundary knots, which can either be supplied or default to the extremes of the data.\n    -   Restricted Cubic spline 'rcs()'\n        -   rcs is a also a linear tail-restricted cubic spline function\n\n-   We can choose to modify several parameters, depending on the function\n\n    -   Number of knots\n\n    -   Where to place the knots (or use defaults based on quantiles and number of knots)\n\n    -   Degree of the polynomial. In practice, rarely is a degree over 3 considered\n\n    -   Increasing the number of knots and the degree of the polynomial will increase the flexibility of the model\n\n-   Several different comparisons are shown in the following plots\n\n##### B-spline versus polynomial function\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(fev, aes(x=age, y=height)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + \n  geom_smooth(method=lm, formula=y ~ poly(x, 3), se=FALSE, aes(color=\"Blue\")) + \n  geom_smooth(method=lm, formula=y ~ bs(x,3), se=FALSE, aes(col=\"Green\")) +\n  geom_point(data=newdata, aes(x=age, y=ht.dummy), col=\"Red\", size=3) + \n  scale_colour_manual(name=\"Model\", values=c(\"Blue\", \"Green\"), labels=c(\"poly(x,3)\",\"bs(x,3)\")) + theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![B-Spline with 3 degrees of freedom is the same as a 3 degree of polynomial.

If counts are all small, more like Cox regression\n    -   Multinomial regression: Number of events in smallest categorical outcome level\n    -   Ordinal regression: If few severity events, more like logistic regression. If a wider range of severity, more like linear regression\n\n-   Allowed model complexity is, roughly, 10-15 effective sample size per degree of freedom\n\n    -   These are all approximations, and the allowed sample size can depend on other characteristics of the data too\n\n-   Splines for effect modification (continuous effect modifier and/or continuous predictor of interest)\n\n    -   Choice of model should be dictated by scientific considerations first\n\n    -   Statistically, we have limited power to detect effect modification\n\n    -   Linear terms for modeling effect modification may suffice\n\n-   Flexible models for a precision variable\n\n    -   Often most of the association of the precision variable with the outcome can be capture in a linear term\n\n    -   If justified, can consider a spline model too\n\n    -   Goal of a precision variable is to explain residual variability in the outcome after accounting for the predictor of interest (and, possibly, confounders that are included in the model)\n\n-   Flexible models for confounders\n\n    -   Often it is important to adjust for confounders adequately, so a spline or other flexible function can help\n\n    -   If we are not interested in interpreting the effect of the confounder, than we are free to model it a variety of different ways\n\n        -   Argues for flexibly modeling continuous confounder (limited by the effective sample size)\n\n        -   Note that if the confounder effect really is a straight line, then a cubic spline with linearity constraints on the tails should also fit adequately\n\n    -   There is not much to be lost and potentially much to be gained by pre-specifying a flexible model for a continuous confounder\n\n        -   If it is a straight line, a flexibly spline or a linear tearm can capture the association (either would adjust for confounding)\n\n        -   If it is not a straight line, a flexible spline can capture the assocation while a linear term cannot (spline would more compoletly adjust for confouding)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(fev, aes(x=height, y=logfev)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE) +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, formula=y ~ ns(x, df=3), se=FALSE, color=\"Green\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Linear (sraight line) and natural spline (3 d.f.) fits to log of FEV and height.  The relationship is approximately a straight line, which can be capture by either assuming a straight line association or allowing for a flexible fit.](Lec11.DoseResponse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-60-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
