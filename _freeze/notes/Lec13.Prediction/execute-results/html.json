  Focuses on identifying observations (covariates) with similar characteristics\n\n        -   Interest lies in finding clusters that are more (or less) likely to have some outcome of interest\n\n    -   Divide a population into subgroups based on patterns of similar measurement\n\n        -   Clustering can be done by considering one variable (univariable) or multiple variables (multivariable)\n\n        -   Number of clusters can be known or unknown\n\n    -   Examples\n\n        -   Microarrays\n\n        -   fMRI\n\n        -   \"Small $n$, large $p$\" (few subjects, many predictors)\n\n    -   Statistical techniques\n\n        -   Stepwise regression\n\n        -   Regression trees\n\n        -   Other data-driven model building approaches\n\n        -   Getting valid inference (i.e. reliable p-values, unbiased parameter estimates) particularly challenging\n\n            -   Area of active research in Biostatistics\n\n-   Quantifying and comparing distributions\n\n    -   Compare distribution of the outcome variable across levels of the grouping variable or variables\n\n        -   Compare salary in males and females, across professors of the same rank, degree, experience, and field\n\n        -   Compare FEV in smokers and non-smokers, across teenagers of the same age and height\n\n    -   Need to decide which summary measure is appropriate for describing the distribution\n\n        -   Common summary measures: Means, median, geometric mean, odds, rates, hazards\n\n        -   Other measures: Variance, skewness, kurtosis, likelihood of extreme values, quantiles, etc.\n\n    -   May desire estimates within specific subgroups\n\n        -   Estimates of the association within gender, race, or age groups\n\n        -   (This is effect modification)\n\n-   Regression based prediction\n\n    -   Prediction of summary measures\n\n        -   Point prediction\n\n            -   Best single estimate for the measurement that would be obtained, on average, for many individuals with given covariates\n\n        -   Interval prediction\n\n            -   Quantify the uncertainty of the average\n\n            -   Range of summary measure that might be reasonable to observe\n\n    -   Prediction of individual measurements\n\n        -   Point prediction\n\n            -   Best single estimate for the measurement that would be obtained on a single individual with given covariates\n\n        -   Interval prediction\n\n            -   Quantify the uncertainty of the individual prediction\n\n            -   Range of measurements that might reasonably be observed in a future individual with given covariates\n\n### Examples of Prediction\n\n#### Continuous prediction: Creatinine clearance\n\n-   Creatinine is a continuously produced breakdown product in muscles\n\n-   Removed by the kidney through filtration\n\n-   Amount of creatinine cleared by the kidneys in 24 hours is a measure of renal function\n\n    -   Gold standard is to collect urine output for 24 hours, measure creatinine\n\n    -   Would prefer to find a combination of blood and urine measures that can be obtained at one time point, yet still provides accurate prediction of a patient's creatinine clearance\n\n-   Statistical approach\n\n    -   Collect a training dataset to build a regression model for prediction\n\n        -   Measure true creatinine clearance\n\n        -   Measure age, gender, weight, height, blood makers, urinary markers, etc.\n\n        -   Fit a (data driven?) regression model to predict true creatinine clearance\n\n    -   Collect a validation dataset\n\n        -   Use the regression estimates (the $\\beta$s) from the training dataset to see how well your model predict creatinine clearance\n\n        -   Quantify the accuracy of the predictive model (e.g. mean squared error)\n\n        -   Cross validation\n\n#### Discrimination (binary prediction): Low birth weight\n\n-   Want to predict which infants are more likely to be less than 2500 grams at birth\n\n-   Possible predictors: Age, race, blood biomarkers collected during pregnancy\n\n-   Statistical Approach\n\n    -   Collect a training dataset to build a regression model for prediction\n\n        -   Measure birth weight\n\n        -   Measure age, race, blood biomarkers\n\n        -   Fit a (data driven?) regression model to predict low birth weight\n\n    -   Collect a validation dataset\n\n        -   Use the regression estimates (the $\\beta$s) from the training dataset to see how well your model predict low birth weight\n\n        -   Quantify the accuracy of the predictive model\n\n            -   Sensitivity, specificity (ROC curves)\n\n            -   Predictive value positive, predictive value negative\n\n#### Interval prediction: Normal ranges of PSA\n\n-   Identify the range of PSA values that would be expected in 95% of most healthy adult males\n\n-   Possibly stratify by age, race\n\n-   Statistical Approach\n\n    -   Collect a training dataset to build a regression model for prediction\n\n        -   Measure PSA and variable to predict PSA\n\n        -   Need to estimate the quantiles\n\n            -   Mean plus/minus 2 standard deviations (makes strong Normality assumption)\n\n            -   Estimate the quantiles, provide CIs around the quantiles (likely low precision)\n\n    -   Collect a validation dataset\n\n        -   Quantify the accuracy of the predictive model (e.g. coverage probabilities)\n\n### Assumptions needed for inference\n\n#### Inference for associations\n\n-   Necessary assumptions for classical regression (no robust standard errors)\n\n    -   Independence of response measurements within identified clusters\n\n    -   Have appropriately modeled the within group variance\n\n        -   Linear regression: Equal variance across groups\n\n        -   Other regressions: Appropriate mean-variance relationship\n\n            -   Lack of model fit may lead to poor estimate of the variance\n\n    -   Sample size is large enough so that parameter estimates approximately follow a Normal distribution\n\n-   Necessary assumptions for first order trends using robust standard errors\n\n    -   Independence of response measurements within identified clusters\n\n    -   (Robust standard errors accounts for heteroscedasticity in large samples)\n\n        -   Lack of model fit leads to conservative inference due to mixing systematic and random error\n\n    -   Sample size is large enough so that parameter estimates approximately follow a Normal distribution\n\n#### Inference for predictions\n\n-   Additional assumptions for predictions of means\n\n    -   Our regression model has accurately described the relationship between summary measures across groups\n\n    -   For continuous covariates, often involves flexible models that allow for departures from linearity\n\n-   Additional assumptions for predictions of individual observations\n\n    -   Also need to know the shape of the distribution within each group\n\n    -   Methods implemented in software often rely on strong assumptions like Normality\n\n## Estimation (prediction) of summary measures\n\n-   Given age, height, and sex, estimate the mean (or geometric mean) FEV\n\n    -   Use linear regression to obtain estimates and CI\n\n-   Given age and PSA, estimate the probability (or odds) of remaining in remission for 24 months\n\n    -   Use logistic regression to obtain estimates and CI\n\n-   Assumptions\n\n    -   Independence (between clusters for robust SE)\n\n    -   Variance approximated by the model (relaxed for robust SE)\n\n    -   Regression model accurately describes the relationship of summary measures across groups\n\n    -   Sufficient sample sizes for asymptotic distributions of parameters to be a good approximation\n\n### Point estimates\n\n-   Point estimates obtained by substitution of predictor values into the estimated regression equation\n\n    -   $E[\\textrm{Chol} | \\textrm{Age}] = 200 + 0.33 \\times \\textrm{Age}$\n\n        -   Expected cholesterol for 50 year old is $200 + 0.33 \\times 50 = 216.5$\n\n    -   $\\textrm{logodds}(\\textrm{Survival} | \\textrm{Age}) = -0.1365 - 0.007899 \\times \\textrm{Age}$\n\n        -   Expected log-odds of Survival for a 50 year old is $-0.1365 - 0.007899 \\times 50 = -0.53$\n\n        -   Expected odds $= e^{-.53} = 0.59$\n\n        -   Expected probability $= 0.37$\n\n### Interval estimates\n\n-   If assumptions hold, interval estimates can be obtained\n\n    -   We generally find a confidence interval for the transformed quantity, and then back transform to the desired quantity\n\n        -   For logistic regression, calculate the CI for the log odds, the transform to odds or probability\n\n-   Statistical criteria for determining the \"best\" estimate\n\n    -   Consistent: Correct estimate (with infinite sample size)\n\n    -   Precise: Minimum variance among (unbiased) estimators\n\n    -   Common regression methods provide the best estimate in a wide variety of settings\n\n-   Necessary assumptions\n\n    -   Independence\n\n    -   Variance approximated by the model (relaxed for robust SE)\n\n    -   **Regression model accurately describes the relationship among summary measures across groups**\n\n    -   Sufficient sample size so that asymptotic Normality of the parameter estimates holds\n\n-   Interval estimates\n\n    -   When we substitute in the predictor values, it provides an estimate of the model transformation of the summary measure\n\n    -   Model transformation of the summary measure varies by regression setting\n\n        -   Linear regression: Mean\n\n        -   Linear regression on log transformed outcome: Log geometric mean\n\n        -   Logistic regression: Log odds\n\n        -   Poisson regression: Log rate\n\n    -   Formulas for the confidence interval\n\n        -   In general: $\\textrm{(estimate)} \\pm \\textrm{(crit value)} \\times \\textrm{(std error)}$\n\n        -   In linear regression, the $t$ distribution is usually used to obtain the confidence interval\n\n            -   Stata: $\\textrm{(crit value)} = \\texttt{invttail}(df, \\alpha/2)$\n\n            -   R: $\\textrm{(crit value)} = \\texttt{qt}(1-\\alpha/2, df)$\n\n            -   Degrees of freedom $df = n - \\textrm{number of predictors in model}$\n\n        -   In other regressions, we use the standard Normal distribution\n\n            -   Stata: $\\textrm{(crit value)} = \\texttt{invnorm}(1 - \\alpha/2) = 1.96$\n\n            -   R: $\\textrm{(crit value)} = \\texttt{qnorm}(1-\\alpha/2) = 1.96$\n\n-   Interval estimates in Stata\n\n    -   After any regression command, the Stata command `predict` will give compute estimates and standard errors\n\n    -   `predict varname, [what]`\n\n        -   `varname` is that name of the new variable to be created\n\n        -   `what` is one of\n\n            -   xb: The linear predictor (works for all regression)\n\n            -   stdp: Standard error of the linear prediction\n\n            -   p: For logistic regression, to predicted probability\n\n-   Interval estimates in R\n\n    -   After storing a model, the R function `predict` will give compute estimates and standard errors\n\n    -   `predict(object, se.fit=FALSE, ...)`\n\n        -   `object` is the stored fitted model\n\n        -   `se.fit` will provide the standard error of the fit (defaults to `FALSE`)\n\n        -   See `help(predict)` for more details and options\n\n<!-- -->\n\n```stata\n. gen logfev = log(fev)\n\n. regress logfev height age\n\n      Source |       SS       df       MS              Number of obs =     654\n-------------+------------------------------           F(  2,   651) = 1361.98\n       Model |  58.5363336     2  29.2681668           Prob > F      =  0.0000\n    Residual |  13.9895809   651  .021489372           R-squared     =  0.8071\n-------------+------------------------------           Adj R-squared =  0.8065\n       Total |  72.5259145   653  .111065719           Root MSE      =  .14659\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      logfev |      Coef.

  $V = \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(X_h - \\overline{X})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2}$\n\n    -   $X_h$ is the chosen value of the covariate (e.g. age==10)\n\n    -   Note: As $n \\rightarrow \\infty, V \\rightarrow 0$\n\n## Prediction of Binary Measurements\n\n### Classification (discrimination)\n\n-   Sometimes the scientific question is one of deriving a rule to classify subjects\n\n    -   Diagnosis of prostate cancer: Based on age, race, and PSA, should we make a diagnosis of prostate cancer?\n\n    -   Prognosis of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis: Based on age, bilirubin, albumin, edema, protime, is the patient likely to die within the next year?\n\n-   Classification can be regarded as trying to predict the value of a binary variable\n\n    -   Earlier, we were estimating the probability and odds of relapse within a particular group (a summary measure)\n\n    -   Now we want to decide whether a particular individual will relapse or not (an individual measure)\n\n    -   There is an obvious connection between the above two ideas\n\n        -   The probability or odds tells us everything about the distribution of values\n\n        -   The only possible values are 0 or 1\n\n-   Typical approach\n\n    -   First, use regression model to estimate the probability of event in each group\n\n    -   Second, form a decision rule based on estimated probability of event\n\n        -   If estimate $\\geq c$ (or $\\leq c$), predict outcome is 1\n\n        -   If estimate $< c$ (or $> c$), predict outcome is 0\n\n    -   Quantify the accuracy of the decision rule\n\n    -   For disease $D$ and test $T$\n\n        -   Sensitivity: $\\textrm{Pr}(T^+ | D^+)$\n\n        -   Specificity: $\\textrm{Pr}(T^- | D^-)$\n\n        -   Predicted Value Positive: $\\textrm{Pr}(D^+ | T^+)$\n\n        -   Predicted Value Negative: $\\textrm{Pr}(D^- | T^-)$\n\n### Stepwise model building\n\n-   Old method for considering a large number of covariates that might possibly be predictive of an outcome\n\n    -   \"If stepwise model building had been proposed today, it would not have passed peer review\"\n\n-   Available in all software as an automated tool, but should not be used\n\n-   Avoid recreating the stepwise approach when building your own models manually\n\n-   Major caveats\n\n    -   Overfits your dataset\n\n    -   P-values are not true p-values; they are very anti-conservative\n\n    -   You will often obtain different models if you use \"forward\" or \"backward\" stepwise regression\n\n    -   Ignores confounding effects (a variable could be an important confounder, but itself not be statistically significant in the model)\n\n    -   Without clustering certain predictors, may throw out covariates to make non-sensical model\n\n        -   Suppose race/ethnicity is coded as White, Black, Hispanic, Other\n\n        -   Want to model as 3 dummy variables\n\n        -   Stepwise may throw out one of your dummy variables, keep the rest\n\n        -   Pairwise significance would also be highly dependent on reference group chosen by analyst\n\n-   Two flavors of stepwide model building\n\n    -   Start with no covariates: \"Forward\" stepwise regression\n\n    -   Start with all covariates: \"Backward\" stepwise regression\n\n-   Stepwise procedure proceeds by adding or removing covariates from the model base on the corresponding partial $t$ or $Z$ test\n\n    -   Must pre-specify a \"P to enter\" and \"P to remove\"\n\n    -   To avoid infinite loops, P to enter must be less than P to remove\n\n    -   E.g. Add a variable to the model if $p < 0.05$, but only remove a variable from the model if $p > 0.10$\n\n    -   Repeat the process until you arrive at a final model\n\n### ROC Curves\n\n-   Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves plot the sensitivity against the false positive rate (e.g. 1 - specificity)\n\n-   Ideal tests will have both high sensitivity and high specificity (low false positives)\n\n    -   Graphically depicted as points in the upper left portion of the plot\n\n    -   1:1 line represents a test that is no better than the flip of a coin\n\n-   Test usually involves the classification of some binary outcome by a continuous predictor (or set of continuous predictors)\n\n    -   When the continuous predictor is above some point $c$, the test is said to be positive\n\n    -   ROC curves plots the sensitivity and false positive rate for all possible values of $c$\n\n-   Major drawbacks to ROC analysis\n\n    -   Tempts analyst to find a cutoff point ($c$) when none really exists\n\n    -   Better to treat your covariate or linear prediction as a continuous variable\n\n### Example 1: Age or height to predict smoking\n\n-   Question: Is age or height a better predictor of smoking status?\n\n-   Will compare the ROC curves\n\n    -   Often done use the area under the curve (AUC)\n\n    -   Model with higher AUC is better\n\n    -   A null model (not predictive of outcome) will have area of 0.50\n\n    -   Maximum AUC is 1.0\n\n-   Stata\n\n    -   Fit the logistic regression model\n\n    -   `lroc` creates the ROC curve\n\n    -   `predict` to save the fitted curves\n\n    -   `roccomp` to compare the curves\n\n<!-- -->\n\n```stata\n. logit smoker height\n\nLogistic regression                               Number of obs   =        654\n                                                  LR chi2(1)      =      58.27\n                                                  Prob > chi2     =     0.0000\nLog likelihood = -182.58748                       Pseudo R2       =     0.1376\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      smoker |      Coef.

Multivariable prognostic models: issues in developing models, evaluating assumptions and adequacy, and measuring and reducing errors. Statistics in Medicine. 15(4): 361-87, Feb 1996\n\n    -   A \"Tutorial is Biostatistics\" (frequently appears in Statistics in Medicine)\n\n-   From abstract of paper\n\n    -   \"Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are frequently used in clinical outcomes... however uncritical application of modeling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects.\"\n\n    -   \"... predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation before using predictions in new data series.\"\n\n-   Common problem: Number of predictors being considered ($p$) is larger than the number of events ($m$)\n\n    -   Recommendation: Consider no more than $m/10$ potential predictors in a model\n\n    -   e.g. if event rate is $10\\%$ and $n=200$ then $m=20$; only $2$ potential predictors\n\n-   Step 1: Consider your dataset\n\n    -   Missing data (imputation?)\n\n    -   Interactions (scientific relevance?)\n\n    -   Transformation of predictors (scientific relevance?)\n\n-   Step 2: Data Reduction\n\n    -   Reduce the number of predictors to a manageable amount\n\n    -   Utilize methods that do not consider the outcome (\"unsupervised\" learning)\n\n        -   If you do not use the outcome at this stage, your statistical inference is preserved\n\n        -   Correlations among predictors: Variable clustering, principle components analysis\n\n        -   Scientifically meaningful summary measures\n\n-   Step 3: Fit the model and ...\n\n    -   Evaluate modeling assumptions: Linearity, additivity, distributional assumptions\n\n    -   Use backwards stepwise selection to find a simpler model\n\n        -   Harrell: Remove predictor if $\\chi^2 > 2$ ($p > 0.16$)\n\n    -   Will use *all data* to fit model\n\n-   Step 4: Evaluate model\n\n    -   Bootstrap cross-validation\n\n        -   Sample data with replacement\n\n        -   For each bootstrap sample, the evaluation of modeling assumptions and backwards selection will be performed (these steps use the outcome)\n\n        -   Summarize predictive accuracy using a statistic (C-index, Brier score)\n\n    -   Bootstrap cross-validation provides a nearly unbiased estimate of predictive accuracy (e.g. C-index, Brier score) while allowing the entire model to be used for model development\n\n        -   C-index: Area under the ROC curve.
