## R

Course notes and primary examples are based on R. I used the following version of R to build the course notes

```{r}
R.version$version.string
```

It is best to be using the latest version of R.

## Rstudio

Current versions of RStudio support editing and preview of Quarto documents. 

To efficiently use Quarto within RStudio it is **strongly** recommended that you use the [latest release](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) of RStudio.  You need to be using RStudio (v2023.06) or later.

You can download RStudio from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.


## Quarto

Quarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from RStudio, with many new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.

To use Quarto with R, you should install the **rmarkdown** R package:

``` r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Installation of the **rmarkdown** package will also install the **knitr** package so you will have everything required to render documents containing R code.


## R packages

There are many ways to achieve the same results in R. To create the notes, I utilize base R and a variety of different packages that provide one way of obtaining the results. The packages needed used to create the notes are listed at the beggining of each set of notes.

If you do not have the packages installed, they will need to be installed first to recreate the analyses in the notes.  The packages I use and demonstrate may not be unique.  Other packages may do something similar and allow you to arrive at the same final answer.


``` r
install.packages("rms")
```

After installation, you can load the package

``` r
library("rms")
```

## Stata

Stata also should be able to conduct all of these analyses necessary for this course. The main advantage to Stata is that its syntax is relatively straightforward. It also has a menu system that can be used to create code and make the analysis reproducible through .do files.
