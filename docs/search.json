    "text": "Course Description\n\nBIOS 6312\nThis is the second in a two-course series designed for students who seek to develop skills in modern biostatistical reasoning and data analysis. Students learn modern regression analysis and modeling building techniques from an applied perspective. Theoretical principles will be demonstrated with real-world examples from biomedical studies. This course requires substantial statistical computing in software packages and focuses on R; familiarity with R or proficiency in another high-level statistical program (e.g. Stata) is required. The course covers regression modeling for continuous outcomes, including simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and analysis of variance with one-way, two-way, three-way, and analysis of covariance models. This is a brief introduction to models for binary outcomes (logistic models), ordinal outcomes (proportional odds models), count outcomes (Poisson/negative binomial models), and time to event outcomes (Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazard modeling). Incorporated into the presentation of these models are subtopic topics such as regression diagnostics, nonparametric regression, splines, data reduction techniques, model validation, parametric bootstrapping, and a brief introduction to methods for handling missing data. Students are required to take 6312L concurrently. Prerequisite: Biostatistics 6311 or equivalent; familiarity with R or Stata software packages. SPRING.\n\n\nBIOS 6312L\nThis is a discussion section/lab for Modern Regression Analysis. Students will review relevant theory and work on applications as a group. Computing solutions and extensions will be emphasized. Students are required to take 6312 concurrently.",

    "text": "Expectations and Policies\n\nExpecations you can have of me\n\nYou should expect me to provide feedback on homeworks and exams in a timely fashion\nYou should expect me to be responsive to your questions and concerns. If you have emailed me and not received a response with 24 hours, please feel free to email again. It is best to use my VUMC rather than Vanderbilt email address.\n\nAttendance. The course is offered in-person. If you expect to be absent, please let me know and make plans to catch up. Class will start on time.\nCollaboration\n\nDiscussing course content is highly encouraged\nCollaborating on homeworks is highly encouraged, but you need to turn in your own assignment written in your own words\nExams (take home and in class) are individual effort\n\nAcademic honesty\n\nStudents are expected to follow the Vanderbilt Honor Code\n“Vanderbilt University students pursue all academic endeavors with integrity. They conduct themselves honorably, professionally and respectfully in all realms of their studies in order to promote and secure an atmosphere of dignity and trust. The keystone of our honor system is self-regulation, which requires cooperation and support from each member of the University community.”\n\nUse of generative AI algorithms such as ChatGPT\n\n“To ensure all students have an equal opportunity to succeed and to preserve the integrity of the course, students are not permitted to submit text that is generated by artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Claude, Google Bard, or any other automated assistance for any classwork or assessments. This includes using AI to generate answers to assignments, exams, or projects, or using AI to complete any other course-related tasks. Using AI in this way undermines your ability to develop critical thinking, writing, or research skills that are essential for this course and your academic success. Students may use AI as part of their research and preparation for assignments, or as a text editor, but text that is submitted must be written by the student. For example, students may use AI to generate ideas, questions, or summaries that they then revise, expand, or cite properly. AI could also be used to assist in writing code as long as the prompts/tools are cited. Students should be aware of the potential benefits and limitations of using AI as a tool for learning and research. AI systems can provide helpful information or suggestions, but they are not always reliable or accurate. Students should critically evaluate the sources, methods, and outputs of AI systems. Violations of this policy will be treated as academic misconduct. If you have any questions about this policy or if you are unsure whether a particular use of AI is acceptable, please do not hesitate to ask for clarification.”\nPoints of emphasis: you must\n\nCite any text that AI generated (even if you edited it) with a bibliographic entry indicating the name and version of the AI model that you used, the date and time it was used, and the exact query or prompt to generate the results\nCite as above any code that was generated for you. I recommend that you do not use AI to blindly write code for you. Doing so will probably be more work than simply writing the code yourself. You must verify any code that is generated for you is accurate and answers the question in the assignment instructions.\n\nVanderbilt or VUMC resources\n\nhttps://www.vanderbilt.edu/generative-ai/\nhttps://www.vumc.org/dbmi/GenerativeAI\n\n\nLate work\n\nWhile I expect that work will be turned in on time, things can happen to interrupt your schedule\nMy goal is to provide sufficient time for completing all assignments\nIf you anticipate a problem with a due date, it is best to let me know sooner (e.g. when a homework is assigned) rather than later\nLate homeworks will be accepted on a case by case basis. No late homeworks will be accepted after the key is provided.\n\nVoicing concerns and evaluations\n\nPlease feel free to bring up any concerns you have about the course material, how it is being presented, or how you are being evaluated at any time during the semester. I want you to know that your voice will be heard.\nPlease complete the end of course evaluations. They are a valuable resource for me and help to guide changes from year to year. I read all comments and will take them seriously. Comments about what worked well as well as constructive criticism are appreciated",
