    "text": "4 Mediating variables\n\nA mediating variable is a predictor hypothesized to lie on the causal pathway between a predictor of interest and the outcome\nWhether or not to adjust for a mediating variable depends on the scientific question of interest\n\nWithout adjustment, we are estimating the total (causal) effect of the predictor of interest via all pathways on the outcome\nIf we adjust for a mediator, we are estimating the direct (causal) effect via other pathways that do not involve the mediator\n\nIf a potential mediator is identified a priori on scientific grounds, we can estimate the direct effect via pathways other than the mediator, the indirect effect through the mediator, and the degree of mediation (e.g. proportion mediated).\nExample: Depression (predictor) and Crohn’s Disease activitity (outcome) with possible mediators being physical activity, smoking, and sleep quality\n\nMediation models were considered using baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up data\nDepression at baseline was the predictor of interest, mediators were assessed at 6 months, and disease activity at 12 months was the outcome.\nTo establish and estimate the mediation effect, we utilized the four steps originally outlined by Barron and Kenny 1\n\nFirst, we tested that there was a significant effect of depression at baseline with disease activity at 12 months to establish there was an effect to be mediated\nSecond, we estimated the correlation between depression at baseline and each of the potential mediators measured at 6 months\nThird, we tested if each of the mediators at 6 months was associated with disease activity at 12 months while controlling for disease activity at baseline.\nFourth, the mediation package in R was used to estimate various quantities for causal mediation analysis, including average causal mediation effects (indirect effect), average direct effects, proportions mediated, and total effect. This step involves combining estimates from the mediator model (mediator at 6 months outcome, depression at baseline the predictor) and estimates from the outcome model (disease activity at 12 months outcome, mediator at 6 months and depression at baseline as predictors of interest, and controlling for disease activity at baseline) efficiently and with appropriate standard error estimates.\n\nResults\n\n\n1 Baron RM, Kenny DA. The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations. J Pers Soc Psychol. 1986 Dec;51(6):1173-82. doi: 10.1037//0022-3514.51.6.1173. PMID: 3806354.\n\n\nMultiple mediation model path diagram and estimates from structural equations model. Part A shows the total effect of depression at baseline on disease activity at 12 months is that, per one unit increase in depression, disease activity increases by 2.90. Part B show the associations of depression at baseline, mediators at 6 months, and disease activity at 12 months. Individual mediation effects are found by multiplying a by b for each mediator. Of the 2.90 total effect, 0.005 went through sleep, 0.138 went through smoking and 0.107 went through activity. Summing these three value, a total of 0.250 (8.6% mediated) when through the three mediators."

In the Case-Control design, the total number of subjects with Cancer \\((a+c)\\) and without cancer \\((b+d)\\) are fixed by design.\n\n\n\nLung Cancer +\nLung Cancer -\n\n\nSmoker\na\nb\n\n\nNon-Smoker\nc\nd\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, a cohort study samples by exposure (smoking) and then estimates the distribution of the effect in exposure groups\nIn a case-control study, we cannot estimate prevalence (without knowing selection probabilities)\n\ne.g. if doing a 1:1 case-control study, \\((a+c) = b+d\\) so it would look like \\(50\\%\\) of the subjects have cancer\n\nOdds ratios are estimable in either case-control or cohort sampling scheme\n\nCohort study: Odds of cancer among smoker compared to odds of cancer among nonsmokers\nCase-control study: Odds of smoking among cancer compared to odds of smoking among non-cancer\n\nMathematically, these two odds ratios are the same\n\n\n\nOdds ratios are easy to interpret when investigating rare events\n\nOdds = prob / (1 - prob)\nFor rare events, (1 - prob) is approximately 1\n\nOdds is approximately the probability\nOdds ratios are approximately risk ratios\n\nCase-control studies usually used when events are rare\n\n\nSecond (scientific) reason: Linearity\n\nProportions are bounded by 0 and 1\nIt is thus unlikely that a straight line relationship would exists between a proportion and a predictor\n\nUnless the predictor itself is bounded\nOtherwise, there eventually must be a threshold above which the probability does not increase (or only increases a little)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nexpit &lt;- function(x) {exp(x)/(1+exp(x))}\nplot(function(x) expit(x), -4,4, ylab=\"Probabilty\", xlab=\"Predictor\")\n\n\n\n\n\nLogistic function will bound probabilities between 0 and 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThird (scientific) reason: Effect modification\n\nThe restriction on ranges for probabilities makes it likely that effect modification must be present with proportions\nExample: Is the association between 2-year relapse rates and having a positive scan modified by gender?\n\nWomen relapse 40% of the time when the scan is negative, and 95% of the time when the scan is positive (an increase of 55%)\n\nIf men relapse 75% of the time when the scan is negative, then a positive scan can increase the relapse rate to at most 100%, which is only a 25% increase\n\n\n\nProportions\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen\nMen\n\n\nNegative Scan\n40%\n75%\n\n\nPositive Scan\n95%\n(up to 100%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference\n55%\nUp to 25%\n\n\nRatio\n1.64\n\\(\\leq 1.33\\)\n\n\n\nWith the odds, the association can hold without effect modification\n\n\n\nOdds\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen\nMen\n\n\nNegative Scan\n0.67\n3\n\n\nPositive Scan\n19\n(up to \\(\\infty\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio\n28.5\n\\(&lt; \\infty\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the o dds of positive scan in men was 85.5, then the odds ratio would be exactly 28.5 (no effect modification)\nFourth (statistics) reason:\n\nClassical linear regression requires equal variances across each predictor group\nBut, with binary data, the variance within a group depends on the mean\nFor binary \\(Y\\), \\(E(Y) = p\\) and \\(Var(Y) = p(1-p)\\)\nWith robust standard errors, the mean-variance relationship is not a major problem. However, a logistic model that correctly models the mean-variance relationship will be more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 The simple logistic regression model\n\nModeling the odds of binary response variable \\(Y\\) on predictor \\(X\\)\n\nDistribution: \\(\\textrm{Pr}(Y_i = 1) = p_i\\)\nModel: \\(\\textrm{logit}(p_i) = \\textrm{log}\\left(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times X_i\\)\nWhen \\(X_i = 0\\): log odds = \\(\\beta_0\\)\nWhen \\(X_i = x\\): log odds = \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times x\\)\nWhen \\(X_i = x+1\\): log odds = \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times x + \\beta_1\\)\n\nTo interpret as odds, exponentiate the regression parameters\n\nDistribution: \\(\\textrm{Pr}(Y_i = 1) = p_i\\)\nModel: \\(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} = \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times X_i) = e^{\\beta_0} \\times e^{\\beta_1 \\times X_i}\\)\nWhen \\(X_i = 0\\): odds = \\(e^{\\beta_0}\\)\nWhen \\(X_i = x\\): odds = \\(e^{\\beta_0} \\times e^{\\beta_1 \\times x}\\)\nWhen \\(X_i = x+1\\): odds = \\(e^{\\beta_0} \\times e^{\\beta_1 \\times x} \\times e^{\\beta_1}\\)\n\nTo interpret as proportions (remember proportion = odds / (1 + odds))\n\nDistribution: \\(\\textrm{Pr}(Y_i = 1) = p_i\\)\nModel: \\(p_i = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0} e^{\\beta_1 \\times X_i}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0} e^{\\beta_1 \\times X_i}}\\)\nWhen \\(X_i = 0\\): \\(p_i = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0}}\\)\n\nWhen \\(X_i = x\\): \\(p_i = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0} e^{\\beta_1 \\times x}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0} e^{\\beta_1 \\times x}}\\)\nWhen \\(X_i = x+1\\): \\(p_i = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0} e^{\\beta_1 \\times x} e^{\\beta_1}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0} e^{\\beta_1 \\times x}e^{\\beta_1}}\\)\n\nMost common interpretations found by exponentiating the coefficients\n\nOdds when predictor is 0 found by exponentiating the intercept: \\(\\exp(\\beta_0)\\)\nOdds ratio between groups differing in the values of the predictor by 1 unit found by exponentiating the slope: \\(\\exp(\\beta_1)\\)\n\nStata commands\nlogit respvar predvar, [robust]\n\nProvides regression parameter estimates an inference on the log odds scale (both coefficients with CIs, SEs, p-values)\n\nlogistic respvar predvar, [robust]\n\nProvides regression parameter estimates and inference on the odds ratio scale (only slope with CIs, SEs, p-values)\n\nR Commands\n\nWith rms package, lrm(respvar ~ predvar, ...)\nIn general, glm(respvar ~ predvar, family=“binomial”)"

We did not do a longitudinal study in which repeated measurements were taken on the same subject.\nIf the group log odds are truly linear, then the slope has an exact interpretation as the change in survival due to a one year change in (any) age\nOtherwise, the slope estimates the first order trend of the sample data and we should not treat the estimates of group odds or probabilities as accurate\nIt is difficult to see in the above example, but the CIs around the odds ratios are not symmetric\n\n(Symmetric) CIs are calculated on the log odds scale, and then transformed to the odds scale by expoenentiating the lower and upper limits of the CI\n\n“From logistic regression analysis, we estimate that for each 5 year difference in age, the odds of survival on the Titanic decreased by 3.9%, though this estimate is not statistically significant (\\(p = 0.07\\)). A 95% CI suggests that this observation is not unusual if a group that is five years older might have an odds of survival that was anywhere between 7.9% lower and 0.4% higher than the younger group.”\nThe confidence interval and statistical test given in the output is called a Wald test. Other tests (Score, Likelihood Ratio) are also possible.\n\nAll tests are asymptotically equivalent\nThe Wald test is easiest to obtain, but generally performs the poorest in small sample sizes\nThe Likelihood Ratio test performs the best in small samples. We will discuss it later, including how to obtain the test using post-estimation commands.\nThe Score test is not bad in small samples, but is often hard to obtain from software. It is exactly equal to the Chi-squared test for binary outcomes and categorical predictors.\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Bayesian Estimates and Interpretation\n\nBayesian approach to the logistic model requires specifying the model, prior distributions, and the likelihood\nThe model\n\ne.g. a model for the log odds of survival that is linear in the parameters with an intercept and slope for age\n\nPrior distributions on parameters\n\nFor the simple logistic regression model, we have parameters \\(\\beta_0\\), and \\(\\beta_1\\).\nFor now, we will use default prior distributions that are are intended to be weakly informative in that they provide moderate regularization and help stabilize computation. See the STAN documentation for more details\nAppropriate priors can be based on scientific considerations\nSensitivity analyses can evaluate the the robustness of finding to different prior assumptions\n\nThe likelihood\n\nFor a binomial GLM the likelihood for one observation \\(y\\) can be written as a conditionally binomial probability mass function\n\n\n\\[\\binom{n}{y} \\pi^{y} (1 - \\pi)^{n - y},\\]\n\n\\(n\\) is the known number of trials, \\(\\pi = g^{-1}(\\eta)\\) is the probability of success and \\(\\eta = \\alpha + \\mathbf{x}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is a linear predictor\n\n\n\nFor a sample of size \\(N\\), the likelihood of the entire sample is the product of \\(N\\) individual likelihood contributions.\n\n\n\nBecause \\(\\pi\\) is a probability, for a binomial model the link function \\(g\\) maps between the unit interval (the support of \\(\\pi\\)) and the set of all real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). When applied to a linear predictor \\(\\eta\\) with values in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), the inverse link function \\(g^{-1}(\\eta)\\) therefore returns a valid probability between 0 and 1.\nThe two most common link functions used for binomial GLMs are the\n\nlogit and\nprobit\n\nWith the logit (or log-odds) link function \\(g(x) = \\ln{\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)}\\), the likelihood for a single observation becomes\n\n\\[\\binom{n}{y}\\left(\\text{logit}^{-1}(\\eta)\\right)^y\n\\left(1 - \\text{logit}^{-1}(\\eta)\\right)^{n-y} =\n\\binom{n}{y} \\left(\\frac{e^{\\eta}}{1 + e^{\\eta}}\\right)^{y}\n\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\eta}}\\right)^{n - y}\\]\n\nWith the probit link function \\(g(x) = \\Phi^{-1}(x)\\) yields the likelihood\n\n\\[\\binom{n}{y} \\left(\\Phi(\\eta)\\right)^{y}\n\\left(1 - \\Phi(\\eta)\\right)^{n - y},\\]\nwhere \\(\\Phi\\) is the CDF of the standard normal distribution.\n\nOutput from Bayesian logistic regression using logit link function\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(rstanarm)\nlibrary(bayesplot)\n\nfit2 &lt;- stan_glm(survived ~ age,\n                 data=titanic, family=binomial(),\n                 seed=1234,\n                 refresh=0)\nsummary(fit2, digits=4, prob=c(.025, .5, .975))\n\n\n\nModel Info:\n function:     stan_glm\n family:       binomial [logit]\n formula:      survived ~ age\n algorithm:    sampling\n sample:       4000 (posterior sample size)\n priors:       see help('prior_summary')\n observations: 1046\n predictors:   2\n\nEstimates:\n              mean    sd      2.5%    50%     97.5%\n(Intercept) -0.1343  0.1459 -0.4135 -0.1336  0.1560\nage         -0.0079  0.0044 -0.0169 -0.0078  0.0004\n\nFit Diagnostics:\n           mean   sd     2.5%   50%    97.5%\nmean_PPD 0.4089 0.0217 0.3652 0.4092 0.4512 \n\nThe mean_ppd is the sample average posterior predictive distribution of the outcome variable (for details see help('summary.stanreg')).\n\nMCMC diagnostics\n              mcse   Rhat   n_eff\n(Intercept)   0.0029 0.9994 2533 \nage           0.0001 0.9996 2570 \nmean_PPD      0.0004 1.0004 3073 \nlog-posterior 0.0284 1.0047 1340 \n\nFor each parameter, mcse is Monte Carlo standard error, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence Rhat=1).\n\n\n\nAnd a summary of the prior distributions used\n\n\n\nCode\nprior_summary(fit2, digits = 2)\n\n\nPriors for model 'fit2' \n------\nIntercept (after predictors centered)\n ~ normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5)\n\nCoefficients\n  Specified prior:\n    ~ normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5)\n  Adjusted prior:\n    ~ normal(location = 0, scale = 0.17)\n------\nSee help('prior_summary.stanreg') for more details\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nSlope for age is of primary scientific importance\nA priori we assume that no association between age and survival.

The model did not adjust for other covariates and assumed a logit link function and Binomial likelihood. We assumed a weakly informative prior distribution for the log odds of survival given age (Normal prior with mean 0 and scale 0.17 for \\(\\beta_1\\)). Conditional on the data, the posterior mean estimate indicates that comparing two subjects who differ in age by 5 years, the younger subject has a 1.04 fold increased odds of survival compared to the older subject. A 95% credible for this posterior odds ratio is from 1.00 to 1.09.\nNote that this model does not consider gender, so it is averaging over the males and females. We will revisits this analysis where the age effect is analyzed separately in males and females."

    "text": "4 Inference with Logistic Regression\n\nThe ideas of Signal and Noise found in simple linear regression do not translate well to logistic regression\nWe do not tend to quantify an error distribution with logistic regression\nValid statistical inference (CIs, p-values) about associations requires three general assumptions\nAssumption 1: Approximately Normal distributions for the parameter estimates\n\nLarge N\nNeed for either robust standard errors or classical logistic regression\nDefinition of large depends on the underlying probabilities (odds)\nRecall the rule of thumb for chi-squared tests based on the expected number of events\n\nAssumption 2: Assumptions about the independence of observations\n\nClassical regression: Independence of all observation\nRobust standard errors: Correlated observations within identified clusters\n\nAssumption 3: Assumptions about variance of observations within groups\n\nClassical regression: Mean-variance relationship for binary data\n\nClassical logistic regression estimates SE using model based estimates\nHence in order to satisfy this requirement, linearity of log odds across groups must hold\n\nRobust standard errors\n\nAllows unequal variance across groups\nHence, do not need linearity of log odds across groups to hold\nValid statistical inference (CIs, p-values) about odds of response in specific groups requires a further assumption\n\n\nAssumption 4: Adequacy of the linear model\n\nIf we are trying to borrow information about the log odds from neighboring groups, and we are assuming a straight line relationship, the straight line needs to be true\n\nNeeded for either classical or robust standard errors\nNote that we can model transformations of the measured predictor if we feel a straight line is not appropriate\n\nInference about individual observations (prediction intervals, P-values) in specific groups requires no further assumptions because we have binary data\n\nFor binary data, if we know the mean (proportion), we know everything about the distribution including the variance\nThis differs from linear regression where we can have a correct model for the mean, but the assumption about the error distribution (Normality, homoskedasticity) can be incorrect\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Interpreting “Positive” Results\n\nSlope is statistically different from 0 using robust standard errors\nObserved data is atypical of a setting with no linear trend in odds of response across groups\nData suggests evidence of a trend toward larger (or smaller) odds in groups having larger values of the predictor\n(To the extent the data appears linear, estimates of the group odds or probabilities will be reliable)\n\n\n\n4.2 Interpreting “Negative” Results\n\nMany possible reasons why the slope is not statistically different from 0 using robust standard errors\n\nThere may be no association between the response and predictor\nThere may be an association in the parameter considered, but the best fitting line has zero slope\nThere may be a first order trend in the log odds, but we lacked the precision to be confident that it truly exists (a type II error)"

    "text": "Log-transformation on the response variable\nSuppose we fit a linear regression model with \\(\\log(y)\\), the log-transformed \\(y\\), as the response variable. Under this model, we assume a linear relationship exists between \\(x\\) and \\(\\log(y)\\), such that \\(\\log(y) \\sim N(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x, \\sigma^2)\\) for some \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). In other words, we can model the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(\\log(y)\\) using the model in Equation 2.\n\\[\n\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\n\\tag{2}\\]\nIf we interpret the model in terms of \\(\\log(y)\\), then we can use the usual interpretations for slope and intercept. When reporting results, however, it is best to give all interpretations in terms of the original response variable \\(y\\), since interpretations using log-transformed variables are often more difficult to truly understand.\nIn order to get back on the original scale, we need to use the exponential function (also known as the anti-log), \\(\\exp\\{x\\} = e^x\\). Therefore, we use the model in Equation 2 for interpretations and predictions, we will use Equation 3 to state our conclusions in terms of \\(y\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\exp\\{\\log(y)\\} = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\} \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\} \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nIn order to interpret the slope and intercept, we need to first understand the relationship between the mean, median and log transformations.\n\nMean, Median, and Log Transformations\nSuppose we have a dataset y that contains the following observations:\n\n\n[1] 3 5 6 7 8\n\n\nIf we log-transform the values of y then calculate the mean and median, we have\n\n\n\n\n\nmean_log_y\nmedian_log_y\n\n\n\n\n1.70503\n1.79176\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we calculate the mean and median of y, then log-transform the mean and median, we have\n\n\n\n\n\nlog_mean\nlog_median\n\n\n\n\n1.75786\n1.79176\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a simple illustration to show\n\n\\(\\text{Mean}[{\\log(y)}] \\neq \\log[\\text{Mean}(y)]\\) - the mean and log are not commutable\n\\(\\text{Median}[\\log(y)] = \\log[\\text{Median}(y)]\\) - the median and log are commutable\n\n\n\nInterpretaton of model coefficients\nUsing Equation 2, the mean \\(\\log(y)\\) for any given value of \\(x\\) is \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\); however, this does not indicate that the mean of \\(y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}\\) (see previous section). From the assumptions of linear regression, we assume that for any given value of \\(x\\), the distribution of \\(\\log(y)\\) is Normal, and therefore symmetric. Thus the median of \\(\\log(y)\\) is equal to the mean of \\(\\log(y)\\), i.e \\(\\text{Median}(\\log(y)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\).\nSince the log and the median are commutable, \\(\\text{Median}(\\log(y)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x \\Rightarrow \\text{Median}(y) = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}\\). Thus, when we log-transform the response variable, the interpretation of the intercept and slope are in terms of the effect on the median of \\(y\\).\nIntercept: The intercept is expected median of \\(y\\) when the predictor variable equals 0. Therefore, when \\(x=0\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 0 = \\beta_0 \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nInterpretation: When \\(x=0\\), the median of \\(y\\) is expected to be \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\).\nSlope: The slope is the expected change in the median of \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) increases by 1 unit. The change in the median of \\(y\\) is\n\\[\n\\exp\\{[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)] - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x]\\} = \\frac{\\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)\\}}{\\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}} = \\frac{\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}}{\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}} = \\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\n\\]\nThus, the median of \\(y\\) for \\(x+1\\) is \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\\) times the median of \\(y\\) for \\(x\\).\nInterpretation: When \\(x\\) increases by one unit, the median of \\(y\\) is expected to multiply by a factor of \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\\)."

    "text": "Hat Matrix & Leverage\nRecall from the notes Matrix Form of Linear Regression that \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) can be written as the following:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nCombining Equation 4 and Equation 5, we can write \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}\\) as the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} &= \\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nWe define the hat matrix as an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix of the form \\(\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\). Thus Equation 6 becomes\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y}\n\\tag{7}\\]\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix are a measure of how far the predictor variables of each observation are from the means of the predictor variables. For example, \\(h_{ii}\\) is a measure of how far the values of the predictor variables for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation, \\(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ip}\\), are from the mean values of the predictor variables, \\(\\bar{x}_1, \\bar{x}_2, \\ldots, \\bar{x}_p\\). In the case of simple linear regression, the \\(i^{th}\\) diagonal, \\(h_{ii}\\), can be written as\n\\[\nh_{ii} =  \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_j-\\bar{x})^2}\n\\]\nWe call these diagonal elements, the leverage of each observation.\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix have the following properties:\n\n\\(0 \\leq h_ii \\leq 1\\)\n\\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} = p+1\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of predictor variables in the model.\nThe mean hat value is \\(\\bar{h} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii}}{n} = \\frac{p+1}{n}\\).\n\nUsing these properties, we consider a point to have high leverage if it has a leverage value that is more than 2 times the average. In other words, observations with leverage greater than \\(\\frac{2(p+1)}{n}\\) are considered to be high leverage points, i.e. outliers in the predictor variables. We are interested in flagging high leverage points, because they may have an influence on the regression coefficients.\nWhen there are high leverage points in the data, the regression line will tend towards those points; therefore, one property of high leverage points is that they tend to have small residuals. We will show this by rewriting the residuals from Equation 4 using Equation 7.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{e} &= \\mathbf{Y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y} \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{Y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nNote that the identity matrix and hat matrix are idempotent, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{I}\\), \\(\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{H}\\). Thus, \\((\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{H})\\) is also idempotent. These matrices are also symmetric. Using these properties and Equation 8, we have that the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals \\(\\boldsymbol{e}\\), is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nVar(\\mathbf{e}) &= \\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{e}^T \\\\[10pt]\n&=  (1-\\mathbf{H})Var(\\mathbf{Y})^T(1-\\mathbf{H})^T \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})^T  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})(1-\\mathbf{H})  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2}{n-p-1}\\) is the estimated regression variance. Thus, the variance of the \\(i^{th}\\) residual is \\(Var(e_i) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-h_{ii})\\). Therefore, the higher the leverage, the smaller the variance of the residual. Because the expected value of the residuals is 0, we conclude that points with high leverage tend to have smaller residuals than points with lower leverage."

In Matrix Notation for Multiple Linear Regression, we showed a way to estimate these parameters using matrix alegbra. Another approach for estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is using maximum likelihood estimation.\nA likelihood function is used to summarise the evidence from the data in support of each possible value of a model parameter. Using Equation 1, we will write the likelihood function for linear regression as\n\\[\nL(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n (2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\exp\\bigg\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\bigg\\}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(Y_i\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) response and \\(\\mathbf{X}_i\\) is the vector of predictors for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation. One approach estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is to find the values of those parameters that maximize the likelihood in Equation 2, i.e. maximum likelhood estimation. To make the calculations more manageable, instead of maximizing the likelihood function, we will instead maximize its logarithm, i.e. the log-likelihood function. The values of the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood function are those that maximize the likelihood function. The log-likelihood function we will maximize is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log L(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) &= \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n -\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are \\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y} \\hspace{10mm} \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\frac{1}{n}RSS\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere \\(RSS\\) is the residual sum of squares. Note that the maximum likelihood estimate is not exactly equal to the estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) we typically use \\(\\frac{RSS}{n-p-1}\\). This is because the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) in Equation 4 is a biased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\).

Students learn modern regression analysis and modeling building techniques from an applied perspective. Theoretical principles will be demonstrated with real-world examples from biomedical studies. This course requires substantial statistical computing in software packages and focuses on R; familiarity with R or proficiency in another high-level statistical program (e.g. Stata) is required. The course covers regression modeling for continuous outcomes, including simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and analysis of variance with one-way, two-way, three-way, and analysis of covariance models. This is a brief introduction to models for binary outcomes (logistic models), ordinal outcomes (proportional odds models), count outcomes (Poisson/negative binomial models), and time to event outcomes (Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazard modeling). Incorporated into the presentation of these models are subtopic topics such as regression diagnostics, nonparametric regression, splines, data reduction techniques, model validation, parametric bootstrapping, and a brief introduction to methods for handling missing data. Students are required to take 6312L concurrently. Prerequisite: Biostatistics 6311 or equivalent; familiarity with R or Stata software packages. SPRING.\n\n\nBIOS 6312L\nThis is a discussion section/lab for Modern Regression Analysis. Students will review relevant theory and work on applications as a group. Computing solutions and extensions will be emphasized. Students are required to take 6312 concurrently."

    "text": "Creating the baseline simulation\nBefore exploring how violations of the homoskedasticity assumption influence a regression model, we need a baseline model to compare it against. So, we will begin by simulating a simple linear regression with 1 predictor.

    "text": "Homoskedasticity\nLinear models make an assumption that the variance of the residuals remain constant across the predicted values (homoskedastic). We can see what this looks like by plotting the fitted values relative to the residuals, which was the first plot in the model check plots we created for the last simulation above. We can see that the residuals exhibit relatively the same amount of variance across the fitted values.\n\nplot(model, which = 1)\n\n\n\n\nLet’s simulate a model with heteroskedastic residuals and see what it looks like. We will keep the same intercept and slope parameters as above. The only thing will we do is add an exponential parameter to the error term of the model to create a heteroskedastic outcome in the residuals.\n\n## parameter for heteroskedasticity \nheteroskedasticity_param &lt;- 2\n\n## set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(22)\n\n## data frame for results\nheteroskedastic_sim_params &lt;- data.frame(intercept = NA,\n                      slope = NA,\n                      intercept_se = NA,\n                      slope_se = NA,\n                      model_rse = NA)\n\n## for loop\nfor(i in 1:reps){\n  \n  # the error variance of Y is a function of X plus some random noise\n  Y &lt;- intercept + slope*X + rnorm(n = n, mean = 0, sd = exp(X*heteroskedasticity_param))\n  \n  # model\n  heteroskedastic_model &lt;- ols(Y ~ X, x=TRUE)\n  \n  \n  # variance-covariance matrix\n  vcv &lt;- vcov(heteroskedastic_model)\n  \n  # estimates for the intercept\n  heteroskedastic_sim_params[i, 1] &lt;- heteroskedastic_model$coef[1]\n  \n  # estimates for the slope\n  heteroskedastic_sim_params[i, 2] &lt;- heteroskedastic_model$coef[2]\n  \n  # SE for the intercept\n  heteroskedastic_sim_params[i, 3] &lt;- sqrt(diag(vcv)[1])\n  \n  # SE for the slope\n  heteroskedastic_sim_params[i, 4] &lt;- sqrt(diag(vcv)[2])\n  \n  # model RSE\n  heteroskedastic_sim_params[i, 5] &lt;- heteroskedastic_model$stats[\"Sigma\"]\n  \n}\n\nhead(heteroskedastic_sim_params)\n\n  intercept    slope intercept_se  slope_se model_rse\n1  1.884165 4.743169    0.0989576 0.1735279  2.209417\n2  2.096654 5.246191    0.1156089 0.2027270  2.581189\n3  1.950191 4.884566    0.1109784 0.1946072  2.477805\n4  1.996244 5.062478    0.1135296 0.1990809  2.534765\n5  2.048404 5.156628    0.1130880 0.1983065  2.524906\n6  2.043749 4.992856    0.1283863 0.2251330  2.866469\n\nplot(X, Y, pch = 19)\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between X and Y certainly looks weird given how it starts very tightly on the left side and then fans out on the right side.\nLet’s take the average across all simulations for each coefficient and their corresponding standard errors.\n\napply(heteroskedastic_sim_params, 2, mean)\n\n   intercept        slope intercept_se     slope_se    model_rse \n   2.0006111    5.0038511    0.1119348    0.1962842    2.4991571 \n\n\nThe coefficients of 2.0 for the intercept and 5 for the slope are exactly what we set them as for the simulation. However, notice how much larger the standard errors are for the intercept and slope compared to the original model above. Additionally, notice that the model residual standard error has increased substantially compared to the previous model.\nLet’s get the last model again and check out the fitted vs residual plot.\n\n# fitted vs residuals\nplot(heteroskedastic_model, which = 1)\n\n\n\n\nThat looks like a large amount of heteroskedasticity as the residual variance is no longer homogenous across the range of fitted values. Notice the large fanning out towards the right side of the plot. As the predictions get larger so two does the variability in residuals, which we noticed when we plotted Y and X above.\nWhat we’ve learned is that the estimate of intercept and slope is unbiased for both the heteroskedastic and homoskedastic models, as they both are centered on the parameters that we specified for the simulation (intercept = 2, slope = 5). However, the heteroskedastic model creates greater variance in our coefficients. We can visualize how much uncertainty there is under the heteroskedastic model relative to the homoskedastic model by visualizing the density of the coefficient estimates from our two model simulations.\n\nplt_intercept &lt;- sim_params %&gt;%\n  mutate(model = 'homoskedastic model') %&gt;%\n  bind_rows(\n    heteroskedastic_sim_params %&gt;%\n      mutate(model = 'heteroskedastic model')\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = intercept, fill = model)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\nplt_slope &lt;- sim_params %&gt;%\n  mutate(model = 'homoskedastic model') %&gt;%\n  bind_rows(\n    heteroskedastic_sim_params %&gt;%\n      mutate(model = 'heteroskedastic model')\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = slope, fill = model)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nplt_intercept | plt_slope\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s see how often the 95% coverage interval is covering the true intercept and slope in the heteroskedastic model.\n\ncoverage_interval95(beta_coef = heteroskedastic_sim_params$intercept,\n                    se_beta_coef = heteroskedastic_sim_params$intercept_se,\n                    true_beta = intercept,\n                    model_df = model$df.residual)\n\n$`Probability of Covering the True Value`\n[1] 0.9344\n\n$`95% Probability Coverage Intervals`\n[1] 0.9275374 0.9412626\n\ncoverage_interval95(beta_coef = heteroskedastic_sim_params$slope,\n                    se_beta_coef = heteroskedastic_sim_params$slope_se,\n                    true_beta = slope,\n                    model_df = model$df.residual)\n\n$`Probability of Covering the True Value`\n[1] 0.829\n\n$`95% Probability Coverage Intervals`\n[1] 0.8185637 0.8394363\n\n\nNotice that we are no longer covering the true model values at the 95% level."

Models 1 is more efficient than model 2 for low correlations below 0.5; Model 2 is more efficient than model 1 for high correlations above 0.5; Model 1 and Model 2 are equivalent at rho of 0.5. Model 3, adjustment for baseline, is equivalent to Model 1 when rho is 0 (baseline and followup are not correlated). Otherwise, model 3 is always better than models 1 or 2. For very high correlations, Models 2 and 3 have similar efficiency.

It is hard to examine every characteristic of a distribution across groups\n\nConversely, we can show associations as soon as we establish some information that one variable provides about the other\n\nNegative studies (e.g. studies with p \\(&gt;\\) 0.05 or CI that contains the null value) are sometimes misinterpreted as being evidence of no association\n\nHowever, “Absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence”\n\nTo make negative studies meaningful, we must...\n\nSpecify the type of association that we are looking for (e.g. mean, median)\nQuantify the amount of uncertainty that might differ across groups\n\nIf the uncertainty is small enough, we can conclude there is no evidence for a meaningful difference\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Example: Inference about an association between exposure (E) and disease (D)\n\n5 Exposed (E+) and 5 Unexposed (E-) subjects were followed for one year, and the number of subjects with and without disease are summarized in the following table\n\n\n\nCode\ntab1 &lt;- matrix(c(3,0,2,5),nrow=2, dimnames=list(c(\"E+\",\"E-\"),c(\"D+\",\"D-\")))\ntab1\n\n\n   D+ D-\nE+  3  2\nE-  0  5\n\n\n\nThe number of E+ and E- were fixed by design (5 each). The random variables are the number of subjects (out of 5) who are D+.\nThe scientific question of interest there an association between exposure and increased (or decreased) risk of disease?\nOur analysis plan should take into account the fact that we have a small sample size. For illustration, I will consider both a Bayesian and frequentist approach so the methods can be compared.\n\n\n4.1.1 Frequentist analysis\n\nResults from the unconditional exact test are provided below. The binomial model assumes that the row or columns margins are fixed, which corresponds to the study design. 1\n\n1 A multinomial model would assume the total sample size is fixed, which is a common design but not appropriate here. Fisher’s exact test assumes that both the row and columns margins are fixed, which is rarely found in practice.\n\nCode\n# For comparing proportions\nexact.test(tab1, model=\"binomial\", conf.int = TRUE, to.plot=FALSE)\n\n\n\n    Z-pooled Exact Test\n\ndata:  3 out of 5 vs. 0 out of 5\ntest statistic = 2.0702, first sample size = 5, second sample size = 5,\np-value = 0.06185\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in proportion is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -4.551214e-05  9.235547e-01\nsample estimates:\ndifference in proportion \n                     0.6 \n\n\nCode\n# For confidnece intervals in each group\nbinom.test(x=3,n=5)\n\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  3 and 5\nnumber of successes = 3, number of trials = 5, p-value = 1\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.1466328 0.9472550\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n                   0.6 \n\n\nCode\nbinom.test(x=0,n=5)\n\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  0 and 5\nnumber of successes = 0, number of trials = 5, p-value = 0.0625\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.0000000 0.5218238\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n                     0 \n\n\n\nHow would you summarize the results of the study examining the association between E and D? Critique the following\n\nAnswer 1: Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we conclude that there is no association between exposure E and disease D.\nAnswer 2: Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we lack evidence to conclude that there is an association between exposure E and disease D.\nAnswer 3: We observed incidence rates of 60% in the exposed (95% CI: [15%, 95%]) and 0% in the unexposed (95% CI: [0%, 52%]). The precision of the study was not adequate to demonstrate that such a large difference in incidence rates would be unlikely in the absence of a true association. We estimated a 60% difference in the probability of disease between exposure group (95% CI: [0% to 92%].\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Bayesian approach to 2x2 table analysis\n\nA Bayesian analysis requires specifying appropriate prior distributions for our parameter. Let \\(\\theta_1 = \\textrm{Pr(D+|E+)}\\), \\(\\theta_2 = \\textrm{Pr(D+|E-)}\\), and \\(\\theta = \\theta_1 - \\theta_2\\).\nAssume these prior distribution\n\n\\[\\pi(\\theta_1) \\sim Beta(a_1,b_1)\\] \\[\\pi(\\theta_2) \\sim Beta(a_2,b_2)\\]\n\nWe also have to specify the likelihood the number of subjects (out of 5) who are diseased in the Exposed group and the number of subjects who are diseased in the Unexposed group. Note that this is the same binomial likelihood that is assumed in the frequentist approach above.\n\n\\[X_1 \\sim Bin(5, \\theta_1)\\] \\[X_2 \\sim Bin(5, \\theta_2)\\]\n\nUsing Bayes Rule, the posterior distribution is proportional to the likelihood multiplied by the prior distribution\n\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\np(\\theta_1 | X_1) &\\propto p(X_1|\\theta_1) \\times \\pi(\\theta_1) \\\\\n&\\vdots& \\\\\np(\\theta_1 | X_1) &\\sim Beta(X_1+a_1, (5-X_1) + b_1)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\np(\\theta_2 | X_2) & \\propto p(X_2|\\theta_2) \\times \\pi(\\theta_2) \\\\\n& \\vdots \\\\\np(\\theta_2 | X_2) & \\sim Beta(X_2+a_2, (5-X_2) + b_2)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\nFor the prior distributions, we choose \\(a_1 = a_2 = 0.5\\) and \\(b_1 = b_2 = 2\\). That is, the prior parameters are the same for \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) with prior mean 0.20.2\nThe prior and posterior distributions for \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are summarized below\n\nThe distribution for the Exposed is shifted to the right (relative to the prior) because 3/5 subjects were D+\nThe distribution for the Unexposed is shifted to the left (relative to the prior) because 0/5 subjects were D+\n\n\n2 Mean of Beta(a,b) is a/(a+b)\n\nCode\n# Prior parameters\na &lt;- .5\nb &lt;- 2\n\na/(a+b) # Prior mean\n\n\n[1] 0.2\n\n\nCode\nplot(function(x) dbeta(x,a,b), xlab=\"Theta_1 or Theta_2\", ylab=\"Density\")\nplot(function(x) dbeta(x,a+3,b+2), add=TRUE, col='red')\nplot(function(x) dbeta(x,a+0,b+5), add=TRUE, col='blue')\nlegend(\"topright\",inset=.05,c(\"Prior distribution\",\"Posterior for theta_1 (Exposed)\",\"Posterior for theta_2 (Unexposed)\"), col=c(\"Black\",\"Red\",\"Blue\"), lty=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur scientific question of interest was to compare the disease rates in the exposed versus the unexposed. This was parameterized as a risk difference, \\(\\theta = \\theta_1 - \\theta_2\\). One could derive the distribution for the difference in two beta random variables for the analytical solution. Instead, I will estimate an approximate numerical solution and summarize the posterior distribution of theta using the 2.5th, 50th, 97.5th quantiles and the posterior mean.\n\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(1234)\nbeta.diff.posterior &lt;- rbeta(10000,a+3,b+2) - rbeta(10000,a+0,b+5)\nbeta.diff.prior &lt;- rbeta(10000,a,b) - rbeta(10000,a,b)\nquantile(beta.diff.posterior, c(.025, .5, .975))\n\n\n      2.5%        50%      97.5% \n0.02510584 0.40590062 0.76104128 \n\n\nCode\nmean(beta.diff.posterior)\n\n\n[1] 0.4015628\n\n\nCode\nplot(density(beta.diff.prior), main=\"\", xlab=\"Theta = Theta_1 - Theta_2\")\nlines(density(beta.diff.posterior), col=\"Red\")\nlegend(\"topleft\",inset=0.05, c(\"Prior\",\"Posterior\"), col=c(\"Black\",\"Red\"), lty=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayesian Interpretation\n\nA priori, we assumed the probability of disease in the exposed and unexposed groups was 20%, as represented by independent Beta(0.5, 2) distributions. We were interested in estimating the difference in the risk of disease, exposed versus unexposed. Given the data, the posterior mean probability of disease was 40% higher in the exposed group with a 95% credible interval from 2.5% to 76% higher.\n\nComparison of Bayesian approach to frequentist approach\n\nHere the sample size is small, so the prior distribution has an impact on the findings. If you believe the prior is appropriate, then this impact is appropriate. If you believe the prior is inappropriate, then the results should be calculated under different prior assumptions. It is good practice to consider a range of reasonable prior assumptions (which I have not done here) and evaluate the impact on the findings.\nThe mean estimate of the difference between groups (40% Bayesian, 60% frequentist) differ because of the Bayesian priors used. This is an example of shrinkage– the Bayesian estimate is a weighted average of the the prior (0%, no effect) and the data (60%) while the frequentist estimate puts all of the weight on the observed data (60%).\nThe Bayesian credible interval is tighter than the Frequentist confidence interval. Again, this is due the prior distribution being included in the Bayesian calculation. If you feel the prior is appropriate, then this narrowing of the credible interval is also appropriate. As sample size increases, the two approaches would become more similar."

Provide a Bayesian and Frequentist interpretation.” VUMC aiChat tool, GPT-4. Retrieved 12/28/2023.\nIn simple linear regression, the slope (often denoted as “b” or “beta”) is interpreted as the expected change in the dependent (or response) variable for a one-unit increase in the independent (or predictor) variable, assuming all other variables are held constant.\nFrom a Frequentist perspective, the slope is considered a fixed but unknown value which is estimated from the sample data. If the slope is found to be 2, for instance, it would suggest that for every one-unit increase in our predictor variable, we expect, on average, a 2-unit increase in the response variable. This is based on the data at hand and is subject to sampling variability. Confidence intervals can be constructed around this estimate to provide a range of plausible values for this unknown fixed parameter. If a 95% confidence interval for the slope is (1.5, 2.5), it would suggest that we are 95% confident that the true slope falls within this range.\nIn contrast, a Bayesian approach treats the slope as a random variable. Rather than a single fixed value, the slope has a distribution of possible values. This distribution combines our prior beliefs about what the slope might be (prior distribution) and the observed data (likelihood). The resulting distribution (posterior distribution) reflects our updated belief about the slope after seeing the data. If the mean of the posterior distribution is 2, it suggests that, given the prior and the data, our best guess is that a one-unit increase in the predictor variable corresponds to a 2-unit increase in the response variable on average. A credible interval, say a 95% credible interval of (1.5, 2.5), suggests that there is a 95% probability that the true value of the slope falls within this range, given our prior and the observed data.\n\n\nWhen to use Bayesian or frequentist approaches to estimation2\n\nOn many occasions, if one is careful in execution, both approaches to analysis will yield essentially equivalent inference\nFor small sample sizes, Bayesian approaches with carefully considered priors are often the only way to go because it is difficult to obtain well-calibrated frequentist intervals\nFor medium to large samples, unless there is strong prior information that one wants to incorporate, robust frequentist estimation using sandwich estimation is very appealing because its consistency is guaranteed under mild conditions\nFor highly complex models, a Bayesian approach is often the most convenient way to formulate the model, and computation under the Bayesian approach is the most straightforward\nIn summary, in many instances carefully considered Bayesian and frequentist approach will lead to similar scientific conclusions. My goal is describe the advantages and shortcoming of each approach, but a strong recommendation of one over the other is not given as there is often no reason for stating a preference.\n\n\n2 Wakefield, Jon. Bayesian and Frequentist Regression Methods. Section 1.6, Executive Summary\n\n\n2.3 Uses of Regression\n\nBorrowing information\n\nUse other groups to make estimates in groups with sparse data\nIntuitively, 67 and 69 year olds would provide some relevant information about 68 year olds\nAssuming a straight line relationship tells us about other, even more distant, individuals\nIf we do not want to assume a straight line, we may only want to borrow information from nearby groups\nLocally weighted scatterplot smooth line (lowess) added to the previous figures\nSplines discussed in future lectures\nMay not want to borrow too much information\n\nLinear relationship is an assumption, with often low power to detect departures from linearity\nAlways avoid extrapolating beyond the range of the data (e.g. ages under 65 or over 100)\nDefining “Contrasts”\n\nDefine a comparison across groups to use when answering scientific questions\nIf the straight line relationship holds, the slope is the difference in mean cholesterol levels between groups differing by 1 year in age\nDo we want to assume that comparisons of 65 to 66 year old subjects are the same as comparisons of 95 to 96 year old subjects?\nIf a non-linear relationship, the slope is still the average difference in mean cholesterol levels between groups differing by 1 year in age\nSlope is a (first order or linear) test for trend\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Linear Regression Inference\n\nRegression output provides\n\nEstimates\n\nIntercept: Estimated mean cholesterol when age is 0\nSlope: Estimated average difference in average cholesterol for two groups differing by 1 year in age\nStandard errors\n\nConfidence intervals\nP-values for testing\n\nIntercept is zero (usually unimportant)\nSlope is zero (test for linear trend in means)\n\n\n(Frequentist) Interpretation\n\nFrom linear regression analysis, we estimate that for each year difference in age, the difference in mean cholesterol is 0.32 mg/dL. A 95% confidence interval (CI) suggests that this observation is not unusual if the true difference in mean cholesterol per year difference in age were between 0.05 and 0.59 mg/dL.

In truth, additional assumptions are not needed to make the aforementioned statistical inference about associations. However ...\nValid statistical inference (CIs, p-values) about mean responses in specific groups requires a further assumption\nAssumption 4: Adequacy of the linear model\n\nIf we are trying to borrow information about the mean from neighboring groups, and we are assuming a straight line relationship, the straight line needs to be true\nNo longer saying there is just a linear trend in the means, but now need to believe that all the means lie on a straight line\nNote that we can model transformations of the measured predictor\n\nFor inference about individual observations (prediction intervals, P-values) in specific groups requires another assumption\nAssumption 5: Assumptions about the distribution of the errors within each group (a very strong assumption)\n\nClassically: Errors have the same Normal distribution within each grouping variable\nRobust standard error will not help\nPrediction intervals assume a common error distribution across groups (homoscedasticity)\n\nPossible extension: Errors have the same distribution, but not necessarily Normal (rarely implemented in frequentist software)\n\nBootstrapping\nBayesian analysis\nOther flexible approaches\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Scenario 1: All model assumptions hold\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(1234)\nn &lt;- 200\nregassumptions &lt;- data.frame(x=seq(from=0, to=100, length=n))\n# Linear model correct, Normal errors\nregassumptions$y1 &lt;- 5 + 0.2*regassumptions$x + rnorm(n,0,5)\n# Linear model correct, Skewed errors\nregassumptions$y2 &lt;- 5 + 0.2*regassumptions$x + rlnorm(n,0,1)\n# Linear model correct, errors increasing with predictor (so increasing with Y too)\nregassumptions$y3 &lt;- 5 + 0.2*regassumptions$x + rnorm(n,0,1+regassumptions$x*.1)\n# Linear model incorrect, Normal error\nregassumptions$y4&lt;- 5 + 0.2*regassumptions$x + 0.02*(regassumptions$x)^2 + rnorm(n,0,5)\nggplot(regassumptions, aes(x=x, y=y1)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Scatterplot with best fit line where assumptions of Normality, linearity, homoskedasticity all hold\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel.y1 &lt;- lm(y1 ~ x, data = regassumptions)\ngglm(model.y1)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Diagnostic plots where assumptions of Normality, linearity, homoskedasticity all hold\n\n\n\n\n\nCan estimate the mean of Y at a given value of X\nCan make inference about the association between X and Y (based on the slope)\nCan predict new values of Y given X\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Scenario 2: Error distribution is not Normally distributed\n\n\nCode\nggplot(regassumptions, aes(x=x, y=y2)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Scatterplot with best fit line where the error distribution is skewed to the right\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel.y2 &lt;- lm(y2 ~ x, data = regassumptions)\ngglm(model.y2)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Diagnostic plots where the error distribution is skewed to the right\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the sample size is large enough, we can estimate the mean of Y at a given value of X (Central Limit Theorem)\nIf we use “robust” standard errors, we can make inference about the association between X and Y (based on the slope)\n\nRobust standard error relax the assumption of homoskedasticity/common variance\n\nWe cannot predict new values of Y given X.

Note that this model is still a “linear model”. A “linear model” is linear in the parameters (\\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\)). We can included the quadratic predictor \\(X^2\\) in the model and still have a model that is linear in the parameters.\n\n\nIf we use “robust” standard errors, we can make inference about the association between X and Y (based on the slope, \\(\\beta_1\\))\n\nRobust standard error relax the assumption of homoskedasticity\nWhile the model is not a great fit, \\(\\beta_1\\) may summarize a first-order trend\n\nWe cannot predict new values of Y given X.

    "section": "7 Model Checking",
    "text": "7 Model Checking\n\nMuch statistical literature has been devoted to methods for checking the assumptions for regression models\nMy philosophy: Model checking is generally fraught with peril as it necessarily involves multiple comparisons\n\nWe cannot reliably use the sampled data to assess whether it accurately portrays the population\nWe are more worried about the data from the population that we might not have sampled\nIt is not so much the abnormal points that we see, but the ones that are hiding in the population that will make our model perform badly\nBut, do tend to worry more when we see a tendency to extreme outliers in the sample or clear departures from model assumptions\nIf we over-check our model and make adjustments to the model based on our observed data, we will inflate the type I error rate (i.e. will be more likely to claim statistical significance when it doesn’t really exist). We run the risk of creating a model that fits our data well but does not generalize.\n\nEstimates are biased away from the null\nReported standard errors are too small\nIf we fish through the data, we will always find significant results\nIn clinical trials, often Phase II results are not able to be replicated in Phase III trials\n\n\nInstead of extensive model checking, go back to our choices of inference when planning our analysis\n\nBest to plan for unusual data\nThere is often little to be lost and much to be gained by using the robust standard error estimates\nBy using robust errors, avoids much of the need for model checking\nModel checking is almost entirely data driven\nRobust standard errors is a more logical scientific approach\n\nMinimize the need to presume more knowledge than the question we are trying to answer\nE.g., if we don’t know how the means might differ, why should we presume to know how the variances or the shape of the distribution might behave?\n\n\n\n\n7.1 Residuals versus fitted values\n\nPlot of \\(\\hat{\\epsilon_i}\\) versus \\(\\hat{y_i}\\)\nIf assumptions hold, should be a random pattern about zero. See Figure 5 for example.\nIf you have a priori concerns about non-constant variance, this is one potential check\n\nE.g., it is fairly common for uncertainty to increase with outcome. See Figure 9 for the resulting “fan” pattern that would appear\n\n\n\n\n7.2 Scale-location plot\n\nThe scale-location plot is very similar to residuals vs fitted values, and is used to evaluate the homoskedasticity assumption\nIt uses the square root of the absolute value of standardized residuals instead of plotting the residuals themselves\nWe want to check two things\n\nThat the best fit line is approximately horizontal. If it is, then the average magnitude of the standardized residuals isn’t changing much as a function of the fitted values.\nThat the spread around the fit line doesn’t vary with the fitted values. If so, then the variability of magnitudes doesn’t vary much as a function of the fitted values.\n\n\n\n\n7.3 QQ plot\n\nUsed to evaluate Normality of the residuals\n\nIf assumptions hold, points should lie on a 1:1 line\n\nPlot of standardized residuals versus theoretical quantities from a N(0,1) distribution\n\nIf assumptions hold, the standardized residuals should be a random sample from a N(0,1) distribution\nWe can use quantiles of the Normal distribution to check how closely the observed matches the expected\n\nThe 50th percentile of the residuals should be 0\nThe 75th percentile of the residuals should be 0.67\nThe 90th percentile of the residuals should be 1.28\nThe 95th percentile of the residuals should be 1.64\nThe 97.5th percentil of the residuals should be 1.96\n\n\nSimilar idea would be a histogram or density plot of the (standardized) residuals that could be visually evaluated for Normality\n\n\n\n7.4 Residuals versus leverage\n\nUsed to check for outliers\nPlot can help us to identify influential observations, if there are any\nInfluence differs from leverage. Not all outliers influence the regression coefficient estimates"

differ across height groups?\nScientific justification for summarizing with geometric mean\n\nFEV is a volume\nHeight is a linear dimension\nEach dimension of lung size is proportional to height\nStandard deviation is likely proportional to height\nScience: \\(FEV \\propto Height^3\\) or \\(\\sqrt[3]{FEV} \\propto Height\\)\n\nStatistics: \\(\\textrm{log}(FEV) \\propto 3 \\textrm{ log}(Height)\\)\n\nScience dictates model choice\n\nStatistical preference for (any) transformations of response\n\nMay transform to equal variance across groups\nHomoscedasticity allows for easier inference\n\nStatistical preference for a log transformation\n\nEasier interpretation: multiplicative model\nCompare groups using ratios\n\n\n\n\n10.3 Log Transformed Predictors\n\nInterpretation of log predictor and log link for response\nLog link used to model the geometric mean of \\(Y\\)\nExponentiated slope estimates ratio of geometric means across groups\nLog transformation of predictor compares groups with a \\(k\\)-fold difference in there measured predictors\nEstimated ratio of geometric means\n\n\\(\\exp (\\textrm{log}(k) \\times \\beta_1) = k^{\\beta_1}\\)\n\nInterpretation of model\n\n\\(\\textrm{log GM}[FEV_i | log (height_i)] = -11.9 + 3.12 \\times log(height_i)\\)\n\nEstimate ratio of geometric mean FEV for two groups differing by \\(10\\%\\) in height (a 1.1 fold difference in height)\nTo find: Exponentiate \\(1.1\\) to the slope: \\(1.1^{3.12} = 1.35\\)\n\n“Group that is 10% taller is estimated to have a geometric mean FEV that is 1.35 times higher (35% higher)”\n\nWhy transform the predictor?\n\nTypically chosen according to whether the data are likely to follow a straight line relationship\nLinearity necessary to predict the values of the parameter in individual groups\nLinearity is not necessary to estimate existence of an association\nLinearity is not necessary to estimate a first order trend in the parameter across groups having the sampled distribution of the predictor\n(Inference about these two questions will tend to be conservative if linearity does not hold)\nRarely do we know which transformation of the predictor provides the best linear fit\nAs always, there is significant danger in using the data to estimate the best transformation to use\nIf there is no association of any kind between the response and the predictor, a linear fit (with a zero slope) is correct\nTrying to detect a transformation is thus an informal test for an association (multiple testing, which inflates type I error rate)\nIt is best to choose transformations of the predictor on scientific grounds\nIn practice, it is often true that mean functions are well approximated by a straight line over a small range of the data\n\nExample: In the FEV dataset, the logarithm of height is approximately linear over the range of heights sampled (look at the plot)\nWe can often choose untransformed predictors when science would suggest a non-linear association\nCan have major advantages in interpreting the results of the analysis\nIn the FEV example, it is far more natural to compare heights by difference than by ratios\n\nWe would rather characterize two children as differing by 4 inches in height rather than as the 44 inch child being 10% taller than the 40 inch child\n\n\n\n\n10.4 Looking Ahead to Multivariable Models\n\nThe relative importance of having the “true” transformation for a predictor depends on the statistical role\n\nPredictor of Interest\nEffect Modifiers\nConfounders\nPrecision variables\n\nWe treat these variables different when planning our analysis\n\nPredictor of Interest (should be pre-specified)\n\nIn general, don’t worry about modeling the exact association until you have even established an association (binary search)\nNeed to have a prespecified model for the POI\nSearching for the best fit can inflate the type I error\nMake most accurate, precise inference about the presence of the association first\nExploratory models can suggest models for future analyses\n\nEffect Modifiers (difficult to do right anyway)\n\nModeling of effect modifiers is invariably just a test for the existence of an interaction\nWe rarely have a lot of precision to answer questions in subgroups of the data\nPatterns of interaction can be so complex that it is unlikely that we will really capture the interactions across all subgroups in a single model\nTypically, we would restrict future studies to analyses treating subgroups separately\n\nConfounders (matters the most)\n\nIt is important to have an appropriate model of the association between the confounder and the response\nFailure to accurately model the confounder means that some residual confounding will exist\nHowever, searching for the best model may inflate the type I error for inference about the predictor of interest by overstating the precision of the study\nLuckily, we rarely care about inference for the confounder, so we are free to use inefficient means of adjustment (e.g. a stratified analysis)\n\nPrecision Variables\n\nWhen modeling precision variables, it is rarely worth the effort to use the “best” transformation\nWe usually capture the largest part of the added precision using crude models\nWe generally do not care about estimating association between the response and the precision variable\n\nMost often, precision variables represent known effects on the response"

mean, odds, rate, instantaneous risk of an event (hazard), etc.\nIn multiple linear regression on means, \\(\\theta_i = E[Y_i | X_i, W_{1i}, W_{1i}, \\ldots]\\)\nChoice of correct \\(\\theta_i\\)

Regression\n\nBorrowing information\n\nUse other groups to make estimates in groups with sparse data\n\nIntuitively, 67 and 69 year olds would provide some relevant information about 68 year olds\nAssuming a straight line relationship tells us about other, even more distant, individuals\nIf we do not want to assume a straight line, we may only want to borrow information from nearby groups\n\n\nDefining “Contrasts”\n\nDefine a comparison across groups to use when answering scientific questions\nIf the straight line relationship holds, the slope for the POI is the difference in parameter between groups differing by 1 unit in \\(X\\) when all other covariates are held constant\nIf a non-linear relationship in parameter, the slope is still the average difference in parameter between groups differing by 1 unit in \\(X\\) when all other covariates are held constant\n\nSlope is a (first order or linear) test for trend in the parameter\nStatistical jargon: “a contrast” across groups\n\n\nThe major difference between different regression models is the interpretation of the parameters\n\nHow do I want to summarize the outcome?\n\nMean, geometric mean, odds, hazard\n\nHow do I want to compare groups?\n\nDifference, ratio\n\n\nIssues related to the inclusion of covariates remains the same\n\nAddress the scientific question: Predictor of interest, effect modification\nAddress confounding\nIncrease precision\n\nInterpretation of parameters\n\nIntercept\n\nCorresponds to a population with all modeled covariates equal to zero\n\nQuite often, this will be outside the range of the data so that the intercept has no meaningful interpretation by itself\n\n\nSlope\n\nA comparison between groups differing by 1 unit in corresponding covariate, but agreeing on all other modeled covariates\n\nSometimes impossible to use this interpretation when modeling interactions or complex dose-response curves (e.g. a model with age and age-squared)\n\n\n\nStratification versus regression\n\nGenerally, any stratified analysis could be performed as a regression model\n\nStratification adjusts for covariates and all interactions among those covariates\nOur habit in regression is to just adjust for covariates as main effects, and consider interactions less often\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Software\n\nIn Stata or R, we use the same commands as were used for simple regression models\n\nWe just list more variable names\nInterpretations of the CIs, p-values for coefficients estimates now relate to new scientific interpretations of intercept and slopes\nTest of entire regression model also provided (a test that all slopes are equal to zero)\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Example: FEV and Smoking\n\nScientific question: Is the maximum forced expiatory volume (FEV) related to smoking status in children?\nAge ranges from 3 to 19, but no child under 9 smokes in the sample\nModels we will compare\n\nUnadjusted (simple) model: FEV and smoking\nAdjusted for age: FEV and smoking with age (confounder)\nAdjusted for age, height: FEV and smoking with age (confounder) and height (precision)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfev &lt;- read.csv(file=\"data/FEV.csv\")\n\n# Restrict to ages 9 and above\nfev

    "text": "4 Unadjusted versus Adjusted Models\n\n4.1 General comparison\n\nAdjusting for covariates changes the scientific question\n\nUnadjusted models: Slope compares parameters across groups differing by 1 unit in the modeled predictor\n\nGroups may also differ with respect to other variables\n\nAdjusted models: Slope compares parameters across groups differing by 1 unit in the modeled predictor but similar with respect to other model covariates\n\nInterpretation of Slopes\n\nUnadjusted model: \\(g(\\theta | X_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times X_i\\)\n\n\\(\\beta_1\\): Compares \\(\\theta\\) for groups differing by 1 unit in \\(X\\)\n\n(The distribution of \\(W\\) might differ across groups being compared)\n\n\nAdjusted model: \\(g(\\theta | X_i, W_i) = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 \\times X_i + \\gamma_2 \\times W_i\\)\n\n\\(\\gamma_1\\): Compares \\(\\theta\\) for groups differing by 1 unit in \\(X\\), but agreeing on their values of \\(W\\)\n\n\nComparing unadjusted and adjusted models\n\nScience questions\n\nWhen does \\(\\gamma_1 = \\beta_1\\)?\nWhen does \\(\\hat{\\gamma}_1 = \\hat{\\beta}_1\\)?\n\nStatistics questions\n\nWhen does \\(se(\\hat{\\gamma_1}) = se(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\)?\nWhen does \\(\\hat{se}(\\hat{\\gamma_1}) = \\hat{se}(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\)\n\nIn above, note placement of the \\(\\hat{ }\\) (“hat”) which signifies estimates of population parameters\nLack of a hat indicates “the truth” in the population\nWhen \\(\\hat{\\gamma}_1 = \\hat{\\beta}_1\\) (the formulas are the same), then it must be the case that \\(se(\\hat{\\gamma_1}) = se(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\)\n\nBut our estimates of the standard errors may not be the same\n\nExample of when \\(\\gamma_1 = \\beta_1\\)\n\nWant to compare smokers to non-smokers (POI) with respect to their FEV (response) and have conducted a randomized experiment in which boys and girls (\\(W\\)) are equally represented as smokers and non-smokers\nWhen we compare a random smoker to a random non-smoker, that average difference will be the same if we adjust for gender or not\nNumbers in unadjusted and adjusted analyses are the same, but interpretation is different\n\n\nAnswering these four questions cannot be done in the general case\n\nHowever, in linear regression we can derive exact results\nThese exact results can serve as a basis for examination of other regression models\n\nLogistic regression\nPoisson regression\nProportional hazards regression\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Comparison of Adjusted and Unadjusted Models in Linear Regression\n\n4.2.1 Interpretation of Slopes\n\nUnadjusted model: \\(E[Y_i | X_i] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times X_i\\)\n\n\\(\\beta_1\\): Difference in mean \\(Y\\) for groups differing by 1 unit in \\(X\\)\n\n(The distribution of \\(W\\) might differ across groups being compared)\n\n\nAdjusted model: \\(E[Y_i | X_i, W_i] = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 \\times X_i + \\gamma_2 \\times W_i\\)\n\n\\(\\gamma_1\\): Difference in mean \\(Y\\) for groups differing by 1 unit in \\(X\\), but agreeing in their values of \\(W\\)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Relationships: True Slopes\n\nThe slope of the unadjusted model will tend to be\n\\[\\beta_1 = \\gamma_1 + \\rho_{XW} \\frac{\\sigma_W}{\\sigma_X} \\gamma_2\\]\nHence, true adjusted and unadjusted slopes for \\(X\\) are estimating the same quantity on if\n\n\\(\\rho_{XW} = 0\\) (\\(X\\) and \\(W\\) are truly uncorrelated), OR\n\\(\\gamma_2 = 0\\) (no association between \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\) after adjusting for \\(X\\))\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Relationships: Estimated Slopes\n\nThe estimated slope of the unadjusted model will be\n\\[\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\hat{\\gamma}_1\\left(1 + \\hat{\\gamma}_2 r_{XW} \\left[\\frac{s_W}{s_X(r_{YX} - r_{YW} r_{XW}} \\right] \\right)\\]\nHence, estimated adjusted and unadjusted slopes for \\(X\\) are equal only if\n\n\\(r_{XW} = 0\\) (\\(X\\) and \\(W\\) are uncorrelated in the sample, which can be arranged by experimental design, OR\n\\(\\hat{\\gamma}_2 = 0\\) (which cannot be predetermined because \\(Y\\) is random)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Relationships: True SE\n\nUnadjusted model: \\([se(\\hat{\\beta}_1)]^2 = \\frac{Var(Y|X)}{n Var(X)}\\)\nAdjusted model: \\([se(\\hat{\\gamma}_1)]^2 = \\frac{Var(Y|X, W)}{n Var(X)(1 - r^2_{XW})}\\)\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n    Var(Y|X) & = & \\gamma_2^2 Var(W|X) + Var(Y | X, W) \\\\\n    \\sigma^2_{Y|X} & = & \\gamma_2^2 \\sigma^2_{W|X} + \\sigma^2_{Y|X,W}\n   \\end{aligned}\\]\nHence, \\(se(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = se(\\hat{\\gamma}_1)\\) if,\n\n\\(r_{XW} = 0\\) AND\n\\(\\gamma_2 = 0\\) OR \\(Var(W|X) = 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.5 Relationships: Estimated SE\n\nUnadjusted model: \\([\\hat{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_1)]^2 = \\frac{SSE(Y|X)/(n-2)}{(n-1) s^2_X}\\)\nAdjusted model: \\([\\hat{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_1)]^2 = \\frac{SSE(Y|X, W)/(n-3)}{(n-1) s^2_X (1 - r^2_{XW})}\\)\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n    SSE(Y|X) & = & \\sum(Y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\times X_i)^2 \\\\\n    SSE(Y|X, W) & = & \\sum(Y_i - \\hat{\\gamma}_0 - \\hat{\\gamma}_1 \\times X_i - \\hat{\\gamma}_2 \\times W_i)^2\n   \\end{aligned}\\]\nHence, \\(\\hat{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\hat{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_1)\\) if,\n\n\\(r_{XW} = 0\\) AND\n\\(SSE(Y|X)/(n-2) = SSE(Y|X,W)/(n-3)\\)\n\nNote than when calculated on the same data,\n\n\\(SSE(Y|X) \\geq SSE(Y | X, W)\\)\n\nNow \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\hat{\\gamma}_1\\) if\n\n\\(\\hat{\\gamma}_2 = 0\\), in which case \\(SSE(Y | X) = SSE(Y | X, W)\\), OR\n\\(r_{XW} = 0\\), and \\(SSE(Y | X) &gt; SSE(Y | X, W)\\) if \\(\\hat{\\gamma}_2 \\neq 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.6 Summary: Special Cases\n\nWe are interested in knowing the behavior of unadjusted and adjusted models according to whether\n\n\\(X\\) and \\(W\\) are uncorrelated\n\\(W\\) is associated with \\(Y\\) after adjustment for \\(X\\)\n\nThe 4 key cases are summarized below\n\n\n\n\n\\(r_{XW} = 0\\)\n\\(r_{XW} \\neq 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\gamma_2 \\neq 0\\)\nPrecision\nConfounding\n\n\n\\(\\gamma_2 = 0\\)\nIrrelevant\nVariance Inflation\n\n\n\nWhen \\(X\\) is associated with \\(W\\), and \\(W\\) is associated with \\(Y\\) after we control for \\(X\\), that is what we call confounding\nWhen \\(X\\) is associated with \\(W\\), and \\(W\\) is not associated with \\(Y\\) after we control for \\(X\\), this inflates the variance of the association between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (more on this follows)\nWhen \\(X\\) is not associated with \\(W\\), and \\(W\\) is associated with \\(Y\\) after we control for \\(X\\), this increases the precision of our estimate of the association between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\nWhen \\(X\\) is not associated with \\(W\\), and \\(W\\) is not associated with \\(Y\\) after we control for \\(X\\), there is no reason to be concerned with modeling \\(W\\)\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Precision variables\n\n4.3.1 Precision in Linear Regression\n\nAdjusting for a true precision variable should not impact the point estimate of the association between the POI and the response, but will decrease the standard error\n\\(X, W\\) independent in the population (or a completely randomized experiment) AND \\(W\\) is associated with \\(Y\\) independent of \\(X\\)\n\n\\(\\rho_{XW} = 0\\)\n\\(\\gamma_2 \\neq 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Value\nEstimates\n\n\n\n\nSlopes\n\\(\\beta_1 = \\gamma_1\\)\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\approx \\hat{\\gamma}_1\\)\n\n\nStd

\\hat{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_1)\\)\n\n\n\n\nNote that the standard errors will be smaller in the unadjusted model due to the mean-variance relationship\n\nProportions have minimum variance when \\(p\\) gets close to 0 or 1, and maximum variance at \\(p = 0.5\\)\nOdds have minimum variance when \\(p\\) is \\(0.5\\)\nPrecision variables should be driving probabilities toward 0 or 1\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Precision in Poisson Regression\n\nAdjusting for a precision variable will\n\nHave no effect on the slope (log ratios are linear in log means)\nStandard errors reflect the mean-variance relationship
