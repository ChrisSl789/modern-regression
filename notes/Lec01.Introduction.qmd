* Labs (weekly)
  - Mondays, 1:00 to 1:55 pm - 2525 WEA, Room 11105
  

## Software -- R

* Primary software package will be R
  - Free
  - Most adaptable statistical package
  - Used by the majority of academic Biostatisticians
  - [Rstudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) IDE used to work with R
  - Rstudio includes Quarto, the latest and greatest tool for rendering markdown documents

## Software -- Rstudio and Quarto

* Course notes rendered using Quarto with R code integrated
  - [Quarto](https://quarto.org) allows for creating dynamic content using embedded R (or other software) code
  - Will allow you to see all code used to generate notes
     - I will highlight important R code
  - I am still learning Quarto, so it has more features than I will likely use
* Qauarto covered in first lab, next week

## Software -- Stata
  
* Secondary software package will be Stata
  - My second favorite statistical package
  - Relatively easy syntax
  - Designed for people who know statistics, but don't want to write basic functions
  - Not integrated with Quarto
     - I will provide a list of equivalent Stata commands in labs and lectures, but usually not produce the output

## Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT)

* Two definitions of generative AI, from ChatGPT 3.5
  - Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new, original content by learning patterns from existing data and using them to generate new outputs.
  - Generative AI refers to the use of machine learning algorithms to generate new and original content, such as images, text, and music.
* I prefer to use the [tools available to VUMC](https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/GenerativeAI)
* As with any tool, use with caution
  - Help with generating code, or converting code between languages
  - Help with writing interpretations in more easily understood language
  - The prompt that you use matters.  Also, identical prompts at different times can give different answers
  

## Guiding Principles

* Alternative course title: How to Use Statistics to Answer Scientific Questions (part 2)
  + Put science before statistics
  + Emphasize parameter estimates and confidence intervals (credible intervals, likelihood intervals) over hypothesis testing and p-values 
    - The End of Statistical Significance (Jonathan Sterne)
    - What's Wrong with P-Values (Bland, Altman)
    - Key difference between scientific/clinical significance and statistical significance
* This is a course in Biostatistics, not coding in R/Stata
  + I will show you how to get an interpret the key statistics, but not interpret every number of the Stata output
  + Often there is more than one way to arrive at identical final answers

## Example: Clinical vs Scientific significance

* 5 clinical trials conducted to determine if drug A, B, or C lowers cholesterol
* Assume that a decrease of 10 mg/dl or more is important to clinicians
* Study design
  + Cholesterol measured at baseline, subjects take drug for 1 month, Cholesterol measured at 1 month
  + Change in cholesterol is the outcome of interest

| Trial | Drug | Pts | Mean diff | Std dev | Std error | 95% CI for diff | p-value |
|-------|------|------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | A | 30 | -30 | 191.7 | 49.5 | [-129, 69] | 0.55 |
| 2 | A | 1000 | -30 | 223.6 | 10 | [-49.6, -10.4] | 0.002 |
| 3 | B | 40 | -20 | 147.6 | 33 | [-85, 45] | 0.55 |
| 4 | B | 4000 | -2 | 147.6 | 3.3 | [-8.5, 4.5] | 0.54 |
| 5 | C | 5000 | -6 | 100.0 | 2 | [-9.9, -2.1] | 0.002 |

# Grading and Evaluation

## Evaluation components and grade percentages

* Midterm (25\%)
* Final Exam (25\%)
* Homework and quizzes (25\%)
* Project (25\%)
* Class participation
* This is a 4-credit course.  Your lab and lecture grades will be the same

## Homework

* Up to 1 per week (probably 6 or 7 total)
* Will focus on real data analysis and interpretation with some mathematical derivations of important quantities
* Questions will focus on specific analyses, with questions stated in as scientific terms as possible
* Work handed in should address the scientific questions
   - Format Table and Figures
   - No raw, unformatted output
* Keys will be provided shortly after the homework is turned in
   - No late homework accepted after the key is posted
* Answers in keys may go beyond what is expected of your homework and present concepts in more detail. You are responsible for any material in the keys for exams.
* You may discuss the homework with others in the class, but the work you turn in should be your own
* Use Brightspace to turn in homeworks and receive feedback and grade

## Exams

* Exams: Midterm and Final in class
  - Focus on understanding concepts, not memorizing formulas
  - I will provide an example midterm and final
  - For midterm, you will be allowed 1 page of your own notes
  - For final, you will be allowed 2 pages of your own notes
* Quizzes
  - At my discretion will may have 10-minute quiz in lab

## Project

* Detailed analysis of a dataset
  - Prepare a 4-10 page reporting of your results (excluding tables and figures)
  - Will be assigned at mid-point of course; more details at that time

# Course Materials

## Course notes

* Course notes will be the primary source
* Available on web page: ADD LINK
* Daily class schedule including notes for that day
* Notes will be updated throughout semester

## Recommended Textbook: Regression Methods in Biostatistics

* Vittinghoff, Glidden, Shiboski, and McCulloch
* Pros
   + Covers applied linear, logistic, survival, and repeated measures regression
   + Biomedical orientation
* Cons
   + Does not discuss robust standard errors, which I will use almost exclusively
   + Emphasizes model diagnostics more that I will
   + Does not cover Bayesian approaches
   + Does not cover matrix algebra
   + Little theory and mathematical derivation

## Additional textbooks

* Weisberg, Applied Linear Regression
  + Uses matrix notation and appropriate level of statistical theory for this course
  + Poor for applied data analysis.  Earlier version limited to linear models, no Bayesian approaches
* Bayesian Regression textbook
  + Newer text that I am still evaluating
  + Provides a Bayesian approach to fitting the models we discuss
* I will give recommended readings throughout the semester
* If the course notes and book differ, go with the notes
