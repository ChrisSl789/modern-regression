\hypertarget{bios-6312}{%
\subsubsection{BIOS 6312}\label{bios-6312}}

This is the second in a two-course series designed for students who seek
to develop skills in modern biostatistical reasoning and data analysis.
Students learn modern regression analysis and modeling building
techniques from an applied perspective. Theoretical principles will be
demonstrated with real-world examples from biomedical studies. This
course requires substantial statistical computing in software packages
and focuses on R; familiarity with R or proficiency in another
high-level statistical program (e.g.~Stata) is required. The course
covers regression modeling for continuous outcomes, including simple
linear regression, multiple linear regression, and analysis of variance
with one-way, two-way, three-way, and analysis of covariance models.
This is a brief introduction to models for binary outcomes (logistic
models), ordinal outcomes (proportional odds models), count outcomes
(Poisson/negative binomial models), and time to event outcomes
(Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazard modeling). Incorporated
into the presentation of these models are subtopic topics such as
regression diagnostics, nonparametric regression, splines, data
reduction techniques, model validation, parametric bootstrapping, and a
brief introduction to methods for handling missing data. Students are
required to take 6312L concurrently. Prerequisite: Biostatistics 6311 or
equivalent; familiarity with R or Stata software packages. SPRING.

\hypertarget{bios-6312l}{%
\subsubsection{BIOS 6312L}\label{bios-6312l}}

This is a discussion section/lab for Modern Regression Analysis.
Students will review relevant theory and work on applications as a
group. Computing solutions and extensions will be emphasized. Students

  in the keys for exams.
\item
  You may discuss the homework with others in the class, but the work
  you turn in should be your own
\item
  Use Brightspace to turn in homeworks and receive feedback and grade

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{expectations-and-policies}{%
\subsection{Expectations and Policies}\label{expectations-and-policies}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Expecations you can have of me

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    You should expect me to provide feedback on homeworks and exams in a
    timely fashion
  \item
    You should expect me to be responsive to your questions and
    concerns. If you have emailed me and not received a response with 24
    hours, please feel free to email again. It is best to use my VUMC
    rather than Vanderbilt email address.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Attendance. The course is offered in-person. If you expect to be
  absent, please let me know and make plans to catch up. Class will
  start on time.
\item
  Collaboration

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Discussing course content is highly encouraged
  \item
    Collaborating on homeworks is highly encouraged, but you need to
    turn in your own assignment written in your own words
  \item
    Exams (take home and in class) are individual effort
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Academic honesty

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Students are expected to follow the Vanderbilt Honor Code
  \item
    ``Vanderbilt University students pursue all academic endeavors with
    integrity. They conduct themselves honorably, professionally and
    respectfully in all realms of their studies in order to promote and
    secure an atmosphere of dignity and trust. The keystone of our honor
    system is self-regulation, which requires cooperation and support
    from each member of the University community.''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Use of generative AI algorithms such as ChatGPT

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    You are free to use generative AI in your work, however you
    \textbf{must}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Cite any text that AI generated (even if you edited it) with a
      bibliographic entry indicating the name and version of the AI
      model that you used, the date and time it was used, and the exact
      query or prompt to generate the results
    \item
      Cite as above any code that was generated for you. I recommend
      that you do not use it to blindly write code for you. Doing so
      will probably be more work than simply writing the code yourself.
      You must verify any code that is generated for you is accurate and
      answers the question in the assignment instructions.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    I recommend using Vanderbilt or VUMC resources

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \url{https://www.vanderbilt.edu/generative-ai/}
    \item
      \url{https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/GenerativeAI}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Late work

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    While I expect that work will be turned in on time, things can
    happen to interrupt your schedule
  \item
    My goal is to provide sufficient time for completing all assignments
  \item
    If you anticipate a problem with a due date, it is best to let me
    know sooner (e.g.~when a homework is assigned) rather than later
  \item
    Late homeworks will be accepted on a case by case basis. No late
    homeworks will be accepted after the key is provided.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Voicing concerns and evaluations

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Please feel free to bring up any concerns you have about the course
    material, how it is being presented, or how you are being evaluated
    at any time during the semester. I want you to know that your voice
    will be heard.
  \item
    Please complete the end of course evaluations. They are a valuable
    resource for me and help to guide changes from year to year. I read
    all comments and will take them seriously. Comments about what
    worked well as well as constructive criticism are appreciated
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{accommodations}{%
\subsection{Accommodations}\label{accommodations}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I encourage students who encounter accessibility challenges to
  communicate with me regardless of whether they are registered with
  Equal Opportunity and Access
\item
  Please communicate with me at your earliest convenience so we can
  discuss specific actions to address your needs. I will make every
  effort to accommodate reasonable requests.
\item
  If you have established accommodations with Equal Opportunity and
  Access, I will receive an email notifying me of the request.
\item
  If you need to contact Equal Opportunity and Access to establish
  service, the address is
  \url{https://www.vanderbilt.edu/eeo/disability_services/contact_us.php}
